Controversy exists about the significance of radiographic findings. Our goal is to determine the prevalence of radiographic FAI types and parameters in a hospital population clinically not suspected of having FAI. In addition we assessed whether pain, age and gender are associated with higher prevalences.\nThree hundred ten patients were included in this retrospective study. After applying the exclusion criteria, 262 patients (522 hips) remained. Two observers scored for radiographic parameters. A generalised estimation equation, Pearson's χ(2) test and logistic regression model were used.\nRadiographic signs of FAI were absent in only 58 hips (11.1 %). In the 40 hips (7.7 %) with cam impingement, males were more affected (P < 0.001). In the 330 hips (63.2 %) with pincer impingement, females were more often affected (P < 0.001). In the 82 hips (15.7 %) with signs of mixed type impingement, male hips were significantly (P < 0.001) more often affected. Age had some effect on the prevalence of coxa vara, acetabular index and acetabular retroversion. No correlation with pain was found.\nQuestion: Do radiographic signs associated with femoroacetabular impingement occur with high prevalence at all ages in a hospital population?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Numerous studies have shown that aberrant microRNA (miRNA) expression is associated with the pathogenesis and progression of various human diseases. Hence, serum miRNAs are considered to be potential biomarkers for the diagnosis of human diseases. This study examined whether several miRNAs known to be commonly deregulated in liver diseases are deregulated in the serum of hosts with hepatic schistosomiasis, and thus whether they could serve as potential markers for detection of schistosome infection and evaluation of the effectiveness of chemotherapy.\nWe analyzed the serum levels of six selected candidate miRNA molecules (miR-146b, miR-122, miR-223, miR-199a-5p, miR-199a-3p, miR-34a) from mice, rabbits, buffalos and humans infected with Schistosoma japonicum using qPCR. We evaluated liver pathology by determining the hydroxyproline content in liver tissues. Primary resident liver cells were isolated to quantify the expression level of deregulated miRNAs. Bioinformatics analyses were also conducted to assess the potential function of miR-223.\nUsing a mouse model of Schistosoma japonicum infection, we found that the expression level of serum miR-223 was significantly elevated after infection, but returned to near normal levels after the treatment with praziquantel (PZQ). Importantly, the level of serum miR-223 reflected the extent of liver pathology post-infection. We validated the elevated level of the circulating miR-223 in serum samples of other host species including rabbits, buffalos and humans. In addition, our results showed that miR-223 was primarily located in the Kupffer cells, but its expression levels were significantly up-regulated in hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells and Kupffer cells after infection. Bioinformatics analyses revealed a potential functional role of miR-223 in transcription regulator activity, transcription factor activity and DNA binding.\nQuestion: Is host serum miR-223 a potential new biomarker for Schistosoma japonicum infection and the response to chemotherapy?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: While many studies show a correlation between chronological age and physiological indicators, the nature of this correlation is not fully understood.\nTo perform a comprehensive analysis of the correlation between chronological age and age-related physiological indicators.\nPhysiological aging scores were deduced using principal component analysis from a large dataset of 1,227 variables measured in a cohort of 4,796 human subjects, and the correlation between the physiological aging scores and chronological age was assessed.\nPhysiological age does not progress linearly or exponentially with chronological age: a more rapid physiological change is observed around the age of 55 years, followed by a mild decline until around the age of 70 years.\nQuestion: Does comprehensive Analysis of Large Sets of Age-Related Physiological Indicators reveal Rapid Aging around the Age of 55 Years?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Brain metastases (BMs) are common in melanoma patients.

A pilot study by Australia and New Zealand Melanoma Trials Group (ANZMTG) was conducted to see if accrual was feasible.\nSites canvassed for interest included those who treat melanoma patients, had a proven accrual in previous melanoma trials and who had the relevant infrastructure support. Feasibility forecasts from interested sites were sought. These were compared to the patient numbers documented in the research contracts. A target accrual of 60 patients in 2 years was set. Funding was sought for the pilot study. Basic demographics of the pilot study cohort were collected.\nThe first centre opened December 2008; the first patient was randomised in April 2009. The pilot accruing period concluded in September, 2011. In 30 months, 54 patients from 10 of a total of 17 activated sites in Australia (39, 72%) and in Norway (15, 28%) had been accrued. Feasibility forecasts predicted 133 trial eligible patients per year (including 108 Australian + 25 International patients). Site estimates generally overestimated accrual with 4 of 17 active sites estimating within 50% of target numbers. Sites with patient estimates calculated from records were more accurate than those estimated from memory. The overall recruitment target was lower in the research contracts when compared to the feasibility evaluation. Basic demographics of the pilot study revealed 62% of patients were males; 58% had a single metastasis, 28% had two and 14% had three metastases. 12-month overall survival was 50%.\nQuestion: Is accrual to a randomised trial of adjuvant whole brain radiotherapy for treatment of melanoma brain metastases feasible?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To study the effects of introducing an Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) protocol, modified for gynecological surgery, on length of stay and complications following abdominal hysterectomy.\nObservational study.\nDepartment of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Örebro University Hospital, Sweden.\nEighty-five patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy for benign or malignant indications between January and December 2012, with or without salpingo-oophorectomy. Outcomes were compared with all consecutive patients who had undergone the same surgery from January to December 2011, immediately before establishing the ERAS protocol (n = 120).\nThe ERAS protocol was initiated in January 2012 as part of a targeted implementation program. Data were extracted from patient records and from a specific database.\nLength of stay and the proportion of patients achieving target length of stay (2 days).\nLength of stay was significantly reduced in the study population after introducing the ERAS protocol from a mean of 2.6 (SD 1.1) days to a mean of 2.3 (SD 1.2) days (p = 0.011). The proportion of patients discharged at 2 days was significantly increased from 56% pre-ERAS to 73% after ERAS (p = 0.012). No differences were found in complications (5% vs. 3.5% in primary stay, 12% vs. 15% within 30 days after discharge), reoperations (2% vs. 1%) or readmission (4% vs. 4%).\nQuestion: Does implementing a structured Enhanced Recovery After Surgery ( ERAS ) protocol reduce length of stay after abdominal hysterectomy?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of early postnatal neurotrophin-3 (NT3) support on hearing acquisition.\nA prospective experimental animal study.\nAdenoviral (Ad) vectors expressing green fluorescence protein (GFP) alone or in combination with NT3 were injected into the scala tympani through the round window of 5-postnatal-day-old (P5) rats. Changes in NT3 mRNA level, hearing thresholds, and morphological studies were done after the viral vector injection.\nNT3 mRNA was significantly increased in the Ad-GFP-NT3 group compared to the normal-developmental group and Ad-GFP alone group. GFP was widely expressed in the cochlea such as in the hair cells, supporting cell area, and spiral ganglion neurons. Auditory brainstem response thresholds were significantly lower in the Ad-GFP-NT3 group compared to the normal-developmental group and Ad-GFP alone group at P15.\nQuestion: Does early Postnatal NT-3 Gene Delivery enhance Hearing Acquisition in the Developmental Period?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Previous reports on lymphocyte subpopulations in systemic sclerosis (SSc) are conflicting. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the lymphocyte subsets in SSc patients who were not on immunosuppressive therapy.\nLymphocyte subsets were assessed in the peripheral blood of SSc patients (n = 29) and healthy controls (n = 29) using the four colour flow cytometry method. Correlation studies were also performed in order to assess the relationship between lymphocyte subsets and clinical parameters.\nThe absolute count of lymphocytes (P = 0.0042), CD3+ (P = 0.0014), CD4+ (P = 0.0070), CD8+ (P = 0.021), and CD19+ cells (P = 0.024) was significantly decreased in SSc patients when compared to healthy controls. CD4+/CD8+ ratio and the absolute count of CD56+ cells observed in SSc patients did not significantly differ from controls (P=0.165; P = 0.632, respectively). There was no substantial relationship between the lymphocyte subset levels and clinical features (i.e., SSc subtype, autoantibody profiles, organ involvement), except for a significant inverse correlation of CD19+ cells and the modified Rodnan skin score (r = -0.43, P = 0.020).\nQuestion: Is absolute count of T and B lymphocyte subsets decreased in systemic sclerosis?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated that mouthwash made with the traditional Japanese medicine hangeshashinto exhibits anti-inflammatory action and alleviates oral mucositis scores, including pain complaints, in patients undergoing chemoradiotherapy. However, no study has demonstrated the mechanism underlying how hangeshashinto provides pain relief in oral ulcers.\nThe analgesic effects on pain-related behaviors following the topical application of hangeshashinto were evaluated in an oral ulcer rat model treated with acetic acid using recently developed methods. Indomethacin, the representative anti-inflammatory agent, was intraperitoneally administered. The tissue permeability of the oral mucosa was histologically evaluated after applying the fluorescent substance FluoroGold.\nThe topical application of hangeshashinto in ulcerative oral mucosa suppressed mechanical pain hypersensitivity over 60 min, without any effects on healthy mucosa. The same drug application also inhibited oral ulcer-induced spontaneous pain. Indomethacin administration failed to block the mechanical pain hypersensitivity, though it did largely block spontaneous pain. Topical anesthesia with lidocaine showed hyposensitivity to mechanical stimulation in healthy mucosa. In the ulcer regions in which the oral epithelial barrier was destroyed, deep parenchyma was stained with FluoroGold, in contrast to healthy oral mucosa, in which staining was limiting to the superficial site.\nQuestion: Does the traditional Japanese medicine hangeshashinto alleviate oral ulcer-induced pain in a rat model?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) increases cell migration and is implicated in cancer cell invasion and metastasis. We have previously described the involvement of the transcription factors, nuclear factor I-C2 (NFI-C2) and Forkhead box F1 (FoxF1), in the regulation of EMT and invasion during breast tumor progression. NFI-C2 counteracts these processes and FoxF1 is a directly repressed target of NFI-C2. FoxF1 induces EMT and invasiveness and enhances xenograft tumorigenicity in nude mice. Here we identify oppositely regulated targets of NFI-C2 and FoxF1 involved in these processes and further study a possible role for FoxF1 in tumorigenesis.\nWe used Affymetrix microarray to detect changes in the transcriptome of a mouse mammary epithelial cell line upon overexpression of NFI-C2 or FoxF1. To elucidate the effects and signaling events following FoxF1 overexpression we investigated in vitro invasion capacity and changes in transcription and protein expression resulting from RNAi and inhibitor treatment.\nThe extracellular matrix enzyme lysyl oxidase (LOX) was negatively regulated by NFI-C2 and positively regulated by FoxF1, and upregulation of LOX following FoxF1 overexpression in mouse mammary epithelial cells increased in vitro cell invasion. In the nuclei of FoxF1-overexpressing cells, the phosphorylation of Smad2 decreased, while that of p38 increased. Depletion of LOX by RNAi enhanced phosphorylation of Smad2 by a focal adhesion kinase (FAK)-dependent mechanism. In addition, induced expression of FoxF1 in a non-malignant human mammary epithelial cell line showed that the increase in LOX transcription and the suppression of Smad2 activity are early effects of FoxF1.\nQuestion: Does forkhead Box F1 promote breast cancer cell migration by upregulating lysyl oxidase and suppressing Smad2/3 signaling?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: intimal hyperplasia (IH) and constrictive remodelling are important causes of restenosis following endovascular interventions, such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) with 5-aminolaevulinic (ALA) may prevent restenosis by cellular depletion and the elimination of cholinergic innervation.\nrats (n=90) were subdivided into 4 main groups. In the experimental group (n=36: 3 replications x 4 doses x 3 examination time-points), ALA was administered (200mg/kg i.v.) 2-3h before balloon injury (BI) of the common iliac artery followed by endovascular illumination with 633nm at either 12.5, 25, 50 or 100J/cm diffuser length (dl BI+PDT group). As control groups served the BI+Light only (LO) group (n=36) that received no ALA, the BI only group (n=9) (BI), and a group (n=9) that received a Sham procedure (Sham group).\nplanimetric analysis showed IH of 0.28+/-0.12mm(2) (BI), 0.27+/-0.12mm(2) (BI+LO at 100J/cmdl) in contrast to 0.02+/-0.02mm(2) after BI+PDT at 100J/cmdl at 16 weeks (p<0.05). In the BI+PDT groups, a light-dose increase of a factor 2 led to an IH decrease of 17% (p<0.05). In the BI and BI+LO groups constrictive remodelling was found, in contrast to BI+PDT treated groups at 16 weeks. The staining of cholinergic innervation of the tunic media of the blood vessel wall in BI+PDT showed no damage at the highest fluence.\nQuestion: Does endovascular photodynamic therapy with aminolaevulinic acid prevent balloon induced intimal hyperplasia and constrictive remodelling?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: 5-HT3 receptor antagonists are effective antiemetics for perioperative use. However, their effects on myometrial contractility remain unknown. We examined whether three different 5-HT3 receptor antagonists could affect the contraction of human myometrium.\nSamples of human myometrium were taken from parturients undergoing elective cesarean delivery. Effects of ondansetron, granisetron and tropisetron (over a range of 1-10(4)ng/mL) on spontaneous contraction (ratios of amplitude, interval, and duration of the contraction) were examined and compared to saline controls (n=6 for each agent).\nNone of the three 5-HT3 receptor antagonists significantly affected myometrial contraction.\nQuestion: Do 5-HT3 receptor antagonists alter spontaneous contraction of pregnant myometrium in vitro?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To study whether embryo associated immunosuppressor factor (EASF) is synthesized at the maternal-fetal interface.\nAnti-EASF monoclonal antibody H5D12 was used to identify EASF. Paraffin-embedded sections were prepared from placental and fetal tissues and immunohistochemistry was done by the avidin-biotin-peroxidase technique. EASF was affinity purified using H5D12-Sepharose 4B from culture media of placental villi and analyzed for immunosuppressive activity (by Concanavalin A-induced lymphocyte proliferation assay) and molecular weight identity (by metabolic labeling studies with 35S-methionine followed by immunoprecipitation and SDS-PAGE).\nImmunohistochemical studies demonstrates intense immunostaining of villous syncytiotrophoblast and cytotrophoblast cells of first trimester placental tissues. Hoffbauer cells and decidual cells stained positive. The same cells in second and third trimester placental tissues stained weakly. However, the endothelium and smooth muscle cells of fetal blood vessels, fetal ovarian stroma and primordial follicles, kidney epithelium, cerebral neurons, and glial cells all stained negative. The affinity-purified EASF from the conditioned media of placental villi (less than 12 wk gestational age) was identified as a 37-kDa molecule with immunosuppressive activity. Metabolic labeling studies revealed that placental villi from early gestational age secretes a major factor of 37-kDa and minor factors of 41-kDa and 47-kDa molecular weight.\nQuestion: Is embryo-associated immunosuppressor factor produced at the maternal-fetal interface in human pregnancy?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: The reported rate of developing radiation pneumonitis (RP) in patients receiving definitive radiation therapy (RT) for lung cancer is 5% to 36%. However, this incidence is probably underreported because of the nonspecific symptoms of RP that may be erroneously attributed to another cardiovascular or respiratory disorder. The objective of this study was to evaluate the incidence of RP in lung cancer patients receiving RT or chemoradiation therapy.\nOf the 110 patients that were reviewed, 86 were chosen for a retrospective analysis. A diagnosis of RP was made based on clinical assessment in the first 6 to 12 months after RT. Radiation pneumonitis was graded as per Radiation Therapy Oncology Group grading criteria.\nThe incidence of developing grade 2 or higher RP was significantly associated with addition of chemotherapy. The incidence of RP in patients receiving chemotherapy was 62.7% (42/67) versus 15.8% (3/19) in patients receiving no chemotherapy (P < 0.001). However, there was no significant effect of the type or sequence of chemotherapy on the incidence of RP. The risk of developing RP is 5 times greater in patients receiving chemotherapy when compared with those not receiving this treatment (hazard ratio: 5.0; 95% confidence interval 1.5, 16.1). In addition, patients in age group 61 to 70 years had a significantly increased risk of developing RP compared with patients of age 60 or younger (hazard ratio: 3.0; 95% confidence interval: 1.4, 6.5). Histology and radiation dose were not significant factors in development of RP.\nQuestion: Does chemotherapy significantly increase the risk of radiation pneumonitis in radiation therapy of advanced lung cancer?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Intima-media thickness (IMT) is a well-described marker of cardiovascular disease. In this study we aim to determine whether low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels and disease-related mutation status can predict IMT in patients with severe familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) referred for or on LDL apheresis.\nGenetic screening, lipid profile testing, and IMT measurements were performed on a series of 33 severe FH patients (19 homozygous) on LDL apheresis treatments (LDL 447 ± 151 mg/dL, age range 6-60 years). Data were then compared with literature IMT-LDL data for normal subjects, mild FH patients, and severe FH patients (18, 41, and 6 studies, respectively).\nAge-adjusted IMT was linearly related to LDL levels over a wide range of values (<500 mg/dL), except for the severe FH no-apheresis cohort. Alternatively, our severe FH population (mostly on apheresis) did follow the mild FH/control age-adjusted IMT-LDL relation.\nQuestion: Do low-density lipoprotein levels and not mutation status predict intima-media thickness in familial hypercholesterolemia?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Cognitive dysfunction is common among bariatric surgery candidates and associated with poorer weight loss outcomes. Identification of a brief screening measure to detect cognitive impairment in this population is needed, because comprehensive neuropsychological evaluations may not be available in all clinical settings.\nThe present study examined the utility of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) for detecting cognitive impairment in 30 bariatric surgery candidates by comparing impairment on the MMSE (at varying cutoffs) to impairment on a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery.\nResults indicated that the MMSE showed low sensitivity and specificity in identifying impairment, even at the more stringent MMSE cutoffs of 27 and 28.\nQuestion: Is the Mini-Mental State Exam ( MMSE ) sensitive to cognitive impairment in bariatric surgery candidates?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: It remains unclear whether glycemic fluctuation immediately after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) can affect myocardial damage. This study investigated the impact of glucose fluctuation on myocardial salvage following successful recanalization of primary AMI.\nA total of 36 consecutive patients with AMI were studied. Glycemic variability, as indicated by the mean amplitude of glycemic excursion (MAGE), was measured on a continuous glucose monitoring system. Three subsets (CD14(+)CD16(-), CD14(++)CD16(+) and CD14(+-)CD16(+)) were measured on flow cytometry 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 days after AMI onset. A 2-h oral glucose test was performed in 23 patients who had no previous diagnosis of diabetes and/or glycated hemoglobin <6.5%, after the onset of AMI at 2 weeks. Plasma active glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 level was measured in each sample. The extent of myocardial salvage 7 days after AMI was evaluated on cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging. MAGE and the peak CD14(+)CD16(-) monocyte level were significantly negatively correlated with myocardial salvage index (MSI). MAGE was significantly correlated with peak CD14(+)CD16(-) monocyte level. Of interest, plasma GLP-1 level was significantly positively correlated with MSI and significantly negatively correlated with MAGE.\nQuestion: Is acute-phase glucose fluctuation negatively correlated with myocardial salvage after acute myocardial infarction?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To assess the quality of reporting by randomized controlled trial (RCT) related to dental implants in China during 2000 to 2012 by using the revised Jadad scale and consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT) (2010) statement.\nThe following electronic databases were searched: Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, Database for Chinese Technical Periodicals, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, PubMed, and EMBASE. A total of 19 journals of stomatology in China were also searched manually. The qualities of RCT with dental implant published between 2000 and 2012 were assessed using CONSORT (2010) statement and revised Jadad scale.\nTwenty-eight RCTs related to dental implants were identified. The quality of reporting in 28 articles was low. The mean revised Jadad score was 1.29 ± 0.71 and the CONSORT (2010) score was 9.75 ± 3.60.\nQuestion: Do [ Quality assessment of randomized controlled trials related to dental implant ]?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Cytosolic nonspecific dipetidase (CN2) belongs to the family of M20 metallopeptidases. It was stated in previous articles that higher expression levels of CN2 were observed in renal cell carcinoma and breast cancer. Our study explored the correlation between CN2 and colon carcinogenesis.\nWe analysed the relationship between 183 patients clinicopathological characteristics and its CN2 expression. To detect the levels of CN2 in colon cancer cell lines and colon cancer tissues by western blot. To verify cell proliferation in colon cancer cells with knockdown of CNDP2 and explore the causes of these phenomena.\nThe expression levels of CN2 in clinical colon tumors and colon cancer cell lines were significantly higher than that in normal colon mucosa and colon cell lines. The difference in CN2 levels was associated with tumor location (right- and left-sided colon cancer), but there was no significant association with age, gender, tumor size, tumor grade, tumor stage or serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). Knockdown of CNDP2 inhibited cell proliferation, blocked cell cycle progression and retarded carcinogenesis in an animal model. The signaling pathway through which knockdown of CNDP2 inhibited cell proliferation and tumorigenesis involved in EGFR, cyclin B1 and cyclin E.\nQuestion: Does up-regulation of CNDP2 facilitate the proliferation of colon cancer?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Activation of the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway exacerbates ischemic brain damage. The present study tested the hypothesis that combination treatment with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) modulates the TLR signaling pathway on cerebral vasculature, which leads to neuroprotection in aged rats after stroke.\nFocal cerebral ischemia acutely increased TLR2, TLR4, and interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity on fibrin/fibrinogen-positive vessels in aged rats. Monotherapy of tPA further amplified these signals. However, VELCADE in combination with tPA-blocked stroke- and tPA-potentiated vascular TLR signals, leading to robust reduction of infarct volume compared with respective monotherapies. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of cerebral endothelial cells isolated by laser capture microdissection revealed that the combination treatment increased miR-l46a levels, which was inversely associated with the reduction of vascular interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 immunoreactivity. In vitro, fibrin upregulated interleukin-1 receptor-activated kinases 1 and TLR4 expression and downregulated miR-146a on primary human cerebral endothelial cells. VELCADE elevated miR-146 levels and abolished fibrin-increased interleukin-1 receptor activated kinases 1 proteins.\nQuestion: Is combination therapy with VELCADE and tissue plasminogen activator neuroprotective in aged rats after stroke and targets microRNA-146a and the toll-like receptor signaling pathway?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) is an accepted treatment approach in early-stage breast cancer. In contrast, the potential role of postneoadjuvant chemotherapy after taxane-containing NACT remains unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate postneoadjuvant chemotherapy and further prognostic factors that predict outcome in women without pathologic complete remission (pCR).\nA total of 377 patients with breast cancer who received preoperative chemotherapy were included in this retrospective study. Patients without standard NACT (6 cycles of epirubicin with docetaxel) or primary metastatic breast cancer and locally advanced, inoperable cancer were excluded from further analysis (n = 186). This resulted in a study population of 191 women (30 [15.7%] with pCR; 161 [84.3%] without pCR). Major outcome parameters were event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). The following parameters were tested for their prognostic role: postneoadjuvant chemotherapy, patient age, breast cancer subtype (luminal/HER2-negative tumors, HER2-positive tumors, and triple-negative tumors), histological grade, pCR, residual lymph node invasion, and residual invasive tumor size.\nAt a median follow-up of 54 months, 51 disease relapses (26.7%) and 21 deaths (11%) were observed. In a comparison of patients with pCR with those without, no significant differences in EFS or OS were observed. Postneoadjuvant chemotherapy was significantly associated with shorter OS in patients without pCR.\nQuestion: Does postoperative CMF Ameliorate Poor Outcomes in Women With Residual Invasive Breast Cancer After Neoadjuvant Epirubicin/Docetaxel Chemotherapy?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Salvicine is a novel DNA topoisomerase II inhibitor with potent anticancer activity. In present study, the effect of salvicine against metastasis is evaluated using human breast carcinoma orthotopic metastasis model and its mechanism is further investigated both in animal and cellular levels.\nThe MDA-MB-435 orthotopic xenograft model was applied to detect the antimetastatic effect of salvicine. Potential target candidates were detected and analyzed by microarray technology. Candidates were verified and explored by reverse transcription-PCR and Western blot. Salvicine activities on stress fiber formation, invasion, and membrane translocation were further investigated by immunofluorescence, invasion, and ultracentrifugal assays.\nSalvicine significantly reduced the lung metastatic foci of MDA-MB-435 orthotopic xenograft, without affecting primary tumor growth obviously. A comparison of gene expression profiles of primary tumors and lung metastatic focus between salvicine-treated and untreated groups using the CLOTECH Atlas human Cancer 1.2 cDNA microarray revealed that genes involved in tumor metastasis, particularly those closely related to cell adhesion and motility, were obviously down-regulated, including fibronectin, integrin alpha3, integrin beta3, integrin beta5, FAK, paxillin, and RhoC. Furthermore, salvicine significantly down-regulated RhoC at both mRNA and protein levels, greatly inhibited stress fiber formation and invasiveness of MDA-MB-435 cells, and markedly blocked translocation of both RhoA and RhoC from cytosol to membrane.\nQuestion: Is antimetastatic effect of salvicine on human breast cancer MDA-MB-435 orthotopic xenograft closely related to Rho-dependent pathway?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Previous studies demonstrated that uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) plays a negative role in modulating leukocyte inflammatory responses. The mechanism underneath the role of UCP2 in modulating leukocyte inflammatory responses, however, is incompletely understood. Here, we investigated the effect of UCP2 in polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) chemotaxis.\nFirst, we assessed PMN chemotaxis in zymosan-induced murine peritonitis and found that UCP2(-/-) mice had significantly more migrated PMN in peritoneal lavage compared to their wild-type littermates. In vitro transmigration assays using isolated PMN also showed that PMN from UCP2(-/-) mice migrated faster than those from wild-type mice in response to N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP). Second, in supporting an inhibitory role of UCP2 in PMN transmigration, migrated PMN had a decreased UCP2 expression compared to nonmigrated PMN. In contrast, in streptozotocin-induced diabetic mice in which UCP2 expression was enhanced, PMN chemotaxis was reduced. Third, comparing to UCP2(+/+) PMN, UCP2(-/-) PMN had a stronger upregulation of fMLP-induced surface CD11b/CD18 and CD11a/CD18. Finally, UCP2(-/-) PMN showed a quicker and larger fMLP-triggered intracellular calcium mobilization compared to UCP2(+/+) PMN.\nQuestion: Does uncoupling protein-2 negatively regulate polymorphonuclear leukocytes chemotaxis via modulating [ Ca2+ ] influx?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Toxoplasma gondii is a pathogen implicated in psychiatric disorders. As elevated antibodies to T. gondii are also present in non-symptomatic individuals, we hypothesized that the age during first exposure to the pathogen may affect symptom manifestation. We tested this hypothesis by evaluating neurobehavioral abnormalities and the immune response in mice following adolescent or adult T. gondii infection.\nMice were infected with T. gondii at postnatal day 33 (adolescent/juvenile) or 61 (adult). At 8weeks post-infection (wpi), pre-pulse inhibition of the acoustic startle (PPI) in mice administered MK-801 (0.1 and 0.3mg/kg) and amphetamine (5 and 10mg/kg) was assessed. Peripheral (anti-T. gondii, C1q-associated IgG and anti-GLUN2 antibodies) and central (C1q and Iba1) markers of the immune response were also evaluated. In addition, regional brain expression of N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits (GLUN1 and GLUN2A), glutamatergic (vGLUT1, PSD95) and GABAergic (GAD67) markers, and monoamines (DA, NE, 5-HT) and their metabolites were measured.\nJuvenile and adult infected mice exhibited opposite effects of MK-801 on PPI, with decreased PPI in juveniles and increased PPI in adults. There was a significantly greater elevation of GLUN2 autoantibodies in juvenile-compared to adult-infected mice. In addition, age-dependent differences were found in regional expression of NMDAR subunits and markers of glutamatergic, GABAergic, and monoaminergic systems. Activated microglia and C1q elevations were found in both juvenile- and adult-T. gondii infected mice.\nQuestion: Are anti-NMDA receptor autoantibodies and associated neurobehavioral pathology in mice dependent on age of first exposure to Toxoplasma gondii?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Impaired repetitive movement in persons with Parkinson's disease (PD) is associated with reduced amplitude, paradoxical hastening and hesitations or arrest at higher movement rates. This study examined the effects of movement rate and medication on movement-related cortical oscillations in persons with PD.\nNine participants with PD were studied off and on medication and compared to nine control participants. Participants performed index finger movements cued by tones from 1 to 3 Hz. Movement-related oscillations were derived from electroencephalographic recordings over the region of the contralateral sensorimotor cortex (S1/M1) during rest, listening, or synchronized movement.\nAt rest, spectral power recorded over the region of the contralateral S1/M1 was increased in the alpha band and decreased in the beta band in participants with PD relative to controls. During movement, the level of alpha and beta band power relative to baseline was significantly reduced in the PD group, off and on medication, compared to controls. Reduced movement amplitude and hastening at movement rates near 2 Hz was associated with abnormally suppressed and persistent desynchronization of oscillations in alpha and beta bands.\nQuestion: Are motor cortical oscillations abnormally suppressed during repetitive movement in patients with Parkinson 's disease?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: We sought an optimal medial branch block (MBB) cutoff value for both single and double MBB protocols that would best correlate with a positive outcome of medial branch neurotomy (MBN).\nWe analyzed the percentage of subjective pain relief following MBB, confirmed by numerical rating scale (NRS) in aggravating positions before and 45 minutes after MBB. The percentage of overall pain relief following MBB was plotted against the following outcome variables: degree of subjective pain relief, duration of relief, patient satisfaction and activity level, no other doctor's visits, and reduction in medications use.\nUsing the percent of pain relief post-MBB plotted in 10% increments in the double-MBB group, patients reporting 70% or greater pain relief following MBB showed statistically favorable outcome for the following four criteria: percentage of pain relief, duration of relief, patient satisfaction, and pain medications reduction. In the single MBB group, patients reporting 80% or greater pain relief following MBB had favorable outcomes for improvement in activity level and patient satisfaction.\nQuestion: Does correlation of lumbar medial branch neurotomy result with diagnostic medial branch block cutoff values to optimize therapeutic outcome?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: We sought to evaluate the role of exercise-related changes in left ventricular (LV) relaxation and of LV contractile function and vasculoventricular coupling (VVC) in the pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and to assess myocardial energetic status in these patients.\nTo date, no studies have investigated exercise-related changes in LV relaxation and VVC as well as in vivo myocardial energetic status in patients with HFpEF.\nWe studied 37 patients with HFpEF and 20 control subjects. The VVC and time to peak LV filling (nTTPF, a measure of LV active relaxation) were assessed while patients were at rest and during exercise by the use of radionuclide ventriculography. Cardiac energetic status (creatine phosphate/adenosine triphosphate ratio) was assessed by the use of (31)P magnetic resonance spectroscopy at 3-T.\nWhen patients were at rest, nTTPF and VVC were similar in patients with HFpEF and control subjects. The cardiac creatine phosphate/adenosine triphosphate ratio was reduced in patients with HFpEF versus control subjects (1.57 +/- 0.52 vs. 2.14 +/- 0.63; p = 0.003), indicating reduced energy reserves. Peak maximal oxygen uptake and the increase in heart rate during maximal exercise were lower in patients with HFpEF versus control subjects (19 +/- 4 ml/kg/min vs. 36 +/- 8 ml/kg/min, p < 0.001, and 52 +/- 16 beats/min vs. 81 +/- 14 beats/min, p < 0.001). The relative changes in stroke volume and cardiac output during submaximal exercise were lower in patients with HFpEF versus control subjects (ratio exercise/rest: 0.99 +/- 0.34 vs. 1.25 +/- 0.47, p = 0.04, and 1.36 +/- 0.45 vs. 2.13 +/- 0.72, p < 0.001). The nTTPF decreased during exercise in control subjects but increased in patients with HFpEF (-0.03 +/- 12 s vs. +0.07 +/- 0.11 s; p = 0.005). The VVC decreased on exercise in control subjects but was unchanged in patients with HFpEF (-0.01 +/- 0.15 vs. -0.25 +/- 0.19; p < 0.001).\nQuestion: Is heart failure with preserved ejection fraction characterized by dynamic impairment of active relaxation and contraction of the left ventricle on exercise and associated with myocardial energy deficiency?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: The μ-opioid receptor has been characterized as the main mediator of opioid signalling in neuronal cells. Opioid-induced pain suppression was originally proposed to be mediated by μ-opioid receptor-induced inhibitory effects on cAMP, which is known to mediate inflammatory hypernociception. Recent investigations revealed PI3Kγ and Akt (PKB) as additional elements of μ-opioid receptor signalling. Hence, we investigated the interaction between pronociceptive cAMP and antinociceptive PI3K/Akt signalling pathways.\nThe human neuroblastoma cell line SK-N-LO and primary dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cells from mice were used to elucidate mediators of μ-opioid receptor signalling. In both cellular systems cAMP was manipulated by stimulation of adenylate cyclase and consequent effects on PI3K/Akt signalling were analysed.\nMorphine stimulated Akt phosphorylation on Ser(473) and Thr(308) in a dose- and time-dependent manner indicating a functional μ-opioid receptor/Akt signalling pathway in μ-SK-N-LO cells. This effect of morphine was suppressed by the μ-opioid receptor inhibitor, naloxone, Pertussis toxin, an inhibitor of Gi heterotrimeric G-proteins, and the pan PI3K inhibitor wortmannin. cAMP-elevating agents also suppressed μ-opioid receptor-dependent stimulation of PI3Kγ lipid kinase and Akt activities in SK-N-LO cells and DRG.\nQuestion: Does pI3Kγ integrate cAMP and Akt signalling of the μ-opioid receptor?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Hypermethylation of CpG islands has been associated with silencing of various tumor suppressor genes, and the retinoid acid receptor beta (RARbeta), cellular retinol-binding protein 1 (CRBP1), and tazarotene-induced gene 1 (TIG1) genes have been associated with retinoic acid signaling. To the authors' knowledge, little is known regarding the involvement of these three genes in gastric carcinoma (GC). In this study, the authors investigated the methylation status of these genes and analyzed the role of their DNA methylation in GC.\nDNA methylation of 3 retinoic acid-associated genes was analyzed in 42 samples of GC from 42 patients and in 8 GC cell lines by methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. The mRNA expression levels for these three genes were measured by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR.\nIn 7 of 8 GC cell lines, the CRBP1 gene was hypermethylated, and CRBP1 transcription was inactive. In 6 of 8 GC cell lines, the TIG1 gene was hypermethylated, and TIG1 transcription was inactive. Treatment with demethylating agent 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine restored both CRBP1 and TIG1 transcription. DNA methylation of the RARbeta, CRBP1, and TIG1 genes was detected in 15 of 42 GC samples (36%), 14 of 42 GC samples (33%), and 4 of 42 GC samples (10%), respectively, and in 6 of 30 samples (20%), 0 of 30 samples (0%), and 1 of 30 samples (3%) of corresponding nonneoplastic mucosa. None of the 10 normal gastric mucosa samples from young, healthy individuals demonstrated hypermethylation of any of these genes. DNA methylation of each gene was associated significantly with low mRNA expression of the respective gene. Twenty-four of 42 GC samples (57%) demonstrated hypermethylation of at least 1 of the 3 genes. However, no significant, concordant hypermethylation of these genes was observed.\nQuestion: Is dNA methylation of genes linked with retinoid signaling in gastric carcinoma : expression of the retinoid acid receptor beta , cellular retinol-binding protein 1 , and tazarotene-induced gene 1 genes associated with DNA methylation?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: This study sought to compare the initial success rate of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) for chronic total occlusion (CTO) in a native coronary artery (NCA) in patients with and without previous coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) and to assess predictive factors.\nLandmark novel wiring techniques for CTO-PCI have contributed to improvement in the initial success of CTO-PCI. However, challenges persist in CTO-PCI in NCA in pCABG patients.\nPatients who underwent CTO-PCI in an NCA were selected and classified into 2 groups: pCABG (206 PCIs in 153 patients) and nCABG (1,431 PCIs in 1,139 patients).\nCTO was located more often in the left anterior descending artery (p = 0.0003), and severe calcified lesions were observed more frequently in the pCABG group (p < 0.0001). Although the retrograde attempt was tried more frequently in the pCABG group, the CTO-PCI success rate was significantly lower in the pCABG patients than in the nCABG patients (71% vs. 83%). Longer procedural time and greater radiation exposure were needed in the pCABG patients. Logistic regression analysis among the pCABG patients revealed that intravascular ultrasound use and parallel wiring were positive factors, and lesion tortuosity was a negative factor.\nQuestion: Is initial success rate of percutaneous coronary intervention for chronic total occlusion in a native coronary artery decreased in patients who underwent previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Recent studies in mice and patients suggest that posttransplantation induction of autoimmune responses to tissue-specific antigens contributes to the rejection of major histocompatibility complex mismatched allotransplants. The relevance of this phenomenon to the rejection of major and minor histocompatibility-mismatched allografts performed in large-animal models remains to be established.\nMiniature swine were immunized with cardiac myosin (CM) in Freund's adjuvant and received heterotopic, minor antigen-mismatched heart transplants. T-cell (proliferation and delayed type hypersensitivity [DTH]) and B-cell (antibody) responses specific to CM were measured. The rejection of heart transplants was assessed histologically.\nThree of four swine that were immunized with CM before receiving a minor antigen-mismatched heart transplant exhibited potent DTH, T-cell proliferation and antibody responses to CM and rejected their grafts acutely. The fourth swine, which failed to mount a significant DTH response to CM and displayed low and transient anti-CM antibody titers, demonstrated long-term allograft survival.\nQuestion: Does autoimmune sensitization to cardiac myosin lead to acute rejection of cardiac allografts in miniature swine?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: The mechanism of gastrointestinal damage (mucositis) induced by cancer chemotherapy remains uncertain. The aims of this study were to define the time course and mechanism of small intestinal damage following chemotherapy in humans.\nPatients receiving chemotherapy underwent upper gastrointestinal endoscopy (a maximum of two per patient) with duodenal biopsy prior to chemotherapy and again at 1, 3, 5, and 16 days after chemotherapy. Tissue was taken for morphometry, disaccharidase assays, electron microscopy, and for assessment of apoptosis using the Tdt mediated dUTP-biotin nick end labelling (TUNEL) method. Villus area, crypt length, and mitotic index were measured by a microdissection technique.\nApoptosis increased sevenfold in intestinal crypts at one day, and villus area, crypt length, mitotic count per crypt, and enterocyte height decreased at three days after chemotherapy. Disaccharidase activities remained unchanged. Electron microscopy showed increased open tight junctions of enterocytes at day 3, consistent with more immature cells. All indices improved by 16 days.\nQuestion: Does chemotherapy for cancer cause apoptosis that precedes hypoplasia in crypts of the small intestine in humans?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Intestinal malabsorption of disaccharides or oligosaccharides occurs normally in preterm infants, the majority of the world's adult population when ingesting dairy products, and in sick patients with abnormal intestinal motility or intestinal damage. Although there may be benefit to colonic fermentation, there also could be mucosal damage from excessive fermentation. Moreover, excess fluid in the colon also may impair fermentation. There are few data that address the effects of moderate amounts of carbohydrate, such as 50% of intake, reaching the colon. We addressed the hypothesis that normal weight gain and stool characteristics would occur during disaccharide malabsorption approximating 50% of intake.\nTwelve piglets (aged 17 days) were randomized to receive control sow milk replacement formula (CON; lactose 60 g/L) or CON modified so that lactulose replaced 50% of the lactose (LAC). During a 5- to 7-day period, weight gain and fecal characteristics were observed before autopsy for cecal histology and determination of cecal cell proliferation using bromodeoxyuridine.\nNeither group developed diarrhea. In LAC and CON, formula intakes (g/kg/d) were similar (279 +/- 30 and 280 +/- 35), as were the ratios of weight gain:formula intake (g/mL): 0.23 +/- 0.04 and 0.22 +/- 0.04. Mean cecal cell proliferation was not diminished in the group receiving lactulose (p > .05).\nQuestion: Does moderate disaccharide malabsorption affect weight gain and cecal cell proliferation in piglets?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Previous work has demonstrated that piperonyl butoxide (PBO) not only inhibits microsomal oxidases but also resistance-associated esterases. The ability to inhibit both major metabolic resistance enzymes makes it an ideal synergist to enhance xenobiotics but negates the ability to differentiate which enzyme group is responsible for conferring resistance.\nThis study examines an analogue that retains the ability to inhibit esterases but is restricted in its ability to act on microsomal oxidases, thus allowing an informed decision on resistance enzymes to be made when used in conjunction with the parent molecule.\nQuestion: Does an analogue of piperonyl butoxide facilitate the characterisation of metabolic resistance?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To investigate the effects of moxibustion on the morphology and function of mast cells (MC) at Tianshu (ST25) in rats with trinitro-benzene-sulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitis.\nA total of 53 male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into a normal group and experimental group. In the experimental group, a rat model of TNBS-induced colitis was established, and the rats were then randomly divided into a model group, moxibustion group, moxibustion plus disodium cromoglycate (M + DC) group and moxibustion plus normal saline (M + NS) group. Rats in the moxibustion group received suspended moxibustion at bilateral ST25 for 10 min, once a day for 7 d. Rats in the M + DC and M + NS groups were pretreated with disodium cromoglycate and normal saline at bilateral ST25, respectively, and were then concurrently subjected to the same treatment as rats in the moxibustion group. The hematoxylin-eosin staining method was used to observe histology of the colon and the toluidine blue-improved method was used to observe mast cells at ST25 acupoint areas.\nAn improvement in colonic injury in the moxibustion group was observed and the degranulation ratio of MC at ST25 acupoint was markedly higher in the moxibustion group than in the model group (45.91 ± 11.41 vs 32.58 ± 8.28, P < 0.05). After inhibition of degranulation of MC at ST25 by disodium cromoglycate, no improvement in colon tissue injury was observed.\nQuestion: Does moxibustion activate mast cell degranulation at the ST25 in rats with colitis?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Recent studies have identified signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) as a susceptibility gene for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) in different populations. In order to examine whether the allele distribution of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in gene STAT4 rs7574865 in patients with SLE is different from those of healthy controls in Chinese Northern Han population, we investigated whether the variants of STAT4 rs7574865 were associated with any specific clinical features of SLE.\nWe genotyped SNPs in STAT4 rs7574865 in 252 patients with SLE and 497 healthy controls. All subjects were from the Northern part of Chinese Han population. The genotypes in rs7574865 were determined by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and consequence direct sequencing of PCR products in the DNA samples.\nThere was a significant difference in distribution of the SNPs in rs7574865 between the SLE patients and healthy controls. Compared with healthy controls, there was a significant correlation between TT genotypes in rs7574865 and the risk of SLE when GG genotype was used as a reference genotype after adjusting for gender and age. The frequency of T allele in the SLE patients was strongly significantly higher than that of healthy controls. Furthermore, there was a significant difference in the distribution of SNP in rs7574865 between male and female SLE patients, when compared with healthy controls. The frequency of T allele in rs7574865 in male patients was significantly higher than that of male healthy controls or female patients. There was no significant correlation between the frequencies of T allele in STAT4 rs7574865 and the clinical features of SLE.\nQuestion: Is variation in STAT4 associated with systemic lupus erythematosus in Chinese Northern Han population?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Passive transfer of antibodies through transfusion has been reported to cause adverse consequences. Approximately 1 in 700 individuals of Northern European ancestry lack IgA with up to 40 percent reported as having anti-IgA. Whether these antibodies when passively transfused were associated with reactions was examined.\nRecords were reviewed to identify IgA-deficient (<0.05 mg/dL detectable IgA) apheresis PLT donors with anti-IgA. Transfusion outcomes of products from these donors were compared to outcomes of control transfusions from donors who were not IgA-deficient.\nFour IgA-deficient donors with anti-IgA donated a total of 25 apheresis PLT products transfused to 22 recipients. Of the transfused products, 1 (4.0%) was associated with fever that was classified as unrelated to transfusion. In the control group, 60 donors donated 78 apheresis PLT products transfused to 56 recipients. Among these, an allergic reaction was identified (1.3%). The reaction rates between both groups were not different whether the single event in the anti-IgA group was considered a reaction (chi-squared value 0.735, p = 0.3914) or considered unrelated to transfusion (chi-square value 0.324, p = 0.5694).\nQuestion: Is transfusion of apheresis PLTs from IgA-deficient donors with anti-IgA associated with an increase in transfusion reactions?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Family-centered rounds (FCR) are defined as interdisciplinary bedside teaching rounds with active family participation. The objective of this study was to examine the association of FCR with family experiences and health services use.\nProspective study comparing families with a child admitted to general pediatric inpatient services with and without FCR. The presence of FCR elements was assessed before study enrollment. Study data were obtained by an in-person interview, a follow-up phone interview <1 week after discharge, and medical record review. Family outcomes were informed by Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems measures. Health service use outcomes included hour of discharge, number of medications, and overall charges. Primary analyses included χ(2) and multivariate regression. Secondary analyses by using propensity score matching were performed to account for differences on observed variables.\nA total of 140 of 203 eligible families were enrolled; 97 completed follow-up surveys (49 on FCR team). Compared with non-FCR, FCR families were more likely to report consistent medical information (P < .001), the option of discussing care plan (P < .001), doctors listening carefully (P < .01), and doctors showing respect (P < .001). No differences were found in number of medications (mean 2.4 vs 2.9, P = .26) or discharge time (mean 3:06 pm versus 2:43 pm, P = .39). No difference was found for hospital charges after adjusting for length of stay outliers.\nQuestion: Do family experiences and pediatric health services use associated with family-centered rounds?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Degradation of highly abundant stromal proteins plays an important role in the nitrogen economy of the plant during senescence. Lines of evidence supporting proteolysis within the chloroplast and outside the chloroplast have been reported. Two extra-plastidic degradation pathways, chlorophagy and Rubisco Containing Bodies, rely on cytoplasmic autophagy.\nIn this work, levels of three stromal proteins (Rubisco large subunit, chloroplast glutamine synthetase and Rubisco activase) and one thylakoid protein (the major light harvesting complex protein of photosystem II) were measured during natural senescence in WT and in two autophagy T-DNA insertion mutants (atg5 and atg7). Thylakoid-localized protein decreased similarly in all genotypes, but stromal protein degradation was incomplete in the two atg mutants. In addition, degradation of two stromal proteins was observed in chloroplasts isolated from mid-senescence leaves.\nQuestion: Is stromal protein degradation incomplete in Arabidopsis thaliana autophagy mutants undergoing natural senescence?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Monotherapy with clopidogrel reduced the formation of transplant arteriosclerosis in a murine aortic allograft model. However, the underlying immunologic mechanisms are still unknown.\nFully major histocompatibility complex-mismatched C57BL/6 (H2b) donor aortas were transplanted into CBA.J (H2k) recipients and mice received different doses (1, 10, and 20 mg/kg) of clopidogrel, an antagonist of the P2Y12 ADP receptor on platelets, or control saline for 30 days. Blood was analyzed for changes in adhesion molecule and sCD40L concentrations by ELISA. Grafts were analyzed by histology, morphometry, and immunofluorescence on day 30 after transplantation. Intragraft cytokine mRNA production was analyzed by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction on day 14 after transplantation.\nTreatment with clopidogrel resulted in significantly decreased blood concentrations of sCD40L and P-selectin after transplantation. Cellular analysis of the aortic transplant revealed fewer numbers of infiltrating dendritic cells (CD205+) and macrophages (F4/80+) after application of clopidogrel, whereas T-cells within the graft were unaltered. In addition cellular P-/E-selectin, ICAM-1, and platelet-derived-growth-factor (PDGF)-beta surface expression were significantly reduced as compared with untreated controls. Intragraft mRNA expression confirmed these results and showed significant lower production of P-/E-selectin, ICAM-1, and PDGF-beta after treatment with clopidogrel. Antiglycoprotein-Ib and antiglycoprotein VI had no beneficial effect on the development of transplant arteriosclerosis.\nQuestion: Is attenuation of transplant arteriosclerosis with clopidogrel associated with a reduction of infiltrating dendritic cells and macrophages in murine aortic allografts?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Stentless aortic valve prostheses have excellent hemodynamic profiles, but may be associated with an increased postoperative heart block when compared to conventional prostheses.\nTo assess the effect of an alternative subcoronary implantation technique on postoperative complete heart block (CHB) and permanent pacemaker implantation (PPI) following aortic valve replacement (AVR) with stentless tissue valves.\nA total of 130 consecutive patients undergoing AVR with stentless tissue valves by a single surgeon were studied retrospectively.\nA stentless tissue valve was implanted into 80 patients using the conventional modified subcoronary implantation technique, and 50 patients received a stentless tissue valve by an alternative subcoronary technique in which the inflow suture line is raised at the level of right-non coronary commissure. Data were collected at the time of hospital discharge and at 6-12 months postoperatively.\nIndependent samples t-test was used to compare continuous variables, and categorical variables were compared with the chi-square test.\nUse of this new method reduced postoperative CHB (4.0% vs. 16.3%, P = 0.033), with fewer patients requiring PPI in the early postoperative period (6.0% vs. 18.8%, P = 0.041). Echocardiographic examination showed no differences in the effective orifice area, peak and mean aortic valve gradients, or left ventricular mass index between groups. Trivial or mild aortic regurgitation was found in 3.9% of patients with the conventional modified technique and 4.0% of patients undergoing the alternative technique, during follow-up (P > 0.05).\nQuestion: Does an alternative subcoronary implantation technique decrease the risk of complete heart block after stentless aortic valve replacement?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Genioglossus activity is greater during wakefulness but decreases to a weaker state during sleep in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) patients, compared to healthy subjects. Previous studies suggested that the corticomotor control of the genioglossus was modified in OSAS patients. Intermittent hypoxia (IH), the typical pathophysiological change in OSAS, can induce genioglossus facilitation. The serotonergic neurons of the raphe dorsal (DRN) and magnus nuclei (RMg) are responsive to hypoxia and play important roles in the control of the genioglossus. However, it remains unknown whether DRN and RMg serotonergic neurons are responsible for the facilitated corticomotor activity of the genioglossus during IH. This study explored the influence of IH on the corticomotor activity of the genioglossus by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and the role of DRN and RMg serotonergic neurons in this effect.\nRats were exposed to IH and divided into two groups. In one group, anti-SERT-SAP was microinjected into the DRN and RMg respectively to kill serotonergic neurons. In the other group, artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) was injected. Comparisons were conducted between the two groups during four weeks of IH and four weeks after IH.\nCompared to the corresponding ACSF-injected group, the DRN lesion group and RMg lesion group showed longer TMS latencies and lower amplitudes during IH from the 1st to the 28th day. After 28 days of IH, longer latencies and lower amplitudes were seen only in the DRN lesion group.\nQuestion: Do raphe serotonergic neurons modulate genioglossus corticomotor activity in intermittent hypoxic rats?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) is a common skin tumour that may metastasize and lead to death. We have observed that before actinic keratoses (AK) progress to SCCs they may become tender and inflamed. In some of these, histological examination shows that they are, in fact, SCCs.\nTo study the progression of AK to SCCs.\nWe studied skin tumours from 50 patients with either asymptomatic AK, inflamed AK or SCCs, using immunocytochemistry. The diagnosis of each tumour was confirmed by histological examination.\nStudies of differentiation using heat shock protein 27 showed a stepwise loss of differentiation as the tumours progressed from asymptomatic AK, through inflamed AK to SCCs. During the inflamed AK phase, there was a marked increase in T lymphocytes and Langerhans cells: the number of infiltrating cells diminished as progression to SCC occurred. There was an increase in immunoreactive p53 and the apoptosis inhibitor bcl-2 as tumours progressed from AK to SCCs, and a decrease in Fas and Fas ligand.\nQuestion: Is inflammation associated with progression of actinic keratoses to squamous cell carcinomas in humans?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: We have showed that secretory Apolipoprotein J/Clusterin (sCLU) is down-regulated in senescent, stressed or diseased red blood cells (RBCs). It was hypothesized that sCLU loss relates to RBCs vesiculation, a mechanism that removes erythrocyte membrane patches containing defective or potentially harmful components.\nTo investigate this issue we employed a combination of biochemical and microscopical approaches in freshly prepared RBCs or RBCs stored under standard blood bank conditions, an in vitro model system of cellular aging. We found that sCLU is effectively exocytosed in vivo during membrane vesiculation of freshly prepared RBCs. In support, the RBCs' sCLU content was progressively reduced during RBCs ex vivo maturation and senescence under cold storage due to its selective exocytosis in membrane vesicles. A range of typical vesicular components, also involved in RBCs senescence, like Band 3, CD59, hemoglobin and carbonylated membrane proteins were found to physically interact with sCLU.\nQuestion: Is apolipoprotein J/clusterin in human erythrocytes involved in the molecular process of defected material disposal during vesiculation?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To estimate the prevalence of falls and to identify their associated factors in community-dwelling elderly.\nA descriptive, cross-sectional study.\nPrimary Health Care, Lleida.\nSix hundred and forty people aged 75 and older were included, in possession of a health card and living in single-family houses, through random sampling. Main measurements Data source comes from the survey of frailty in Lleida (FRALLE Survey). The variables used were the occurrence of falls, sociodemographic factors, health status, quality of life related to health and fear of falling.\nThe prevalence of falls was 25.0% (95% CI 24.8-25.1). After multivariate analysis, basic disability (OR=2.17; 95% CI 1.32-3.58), depressive symptoms (OR=1.67; 95% CI 1.07-2.59) and fear of falling (OR=2.53; 95% CI 1.63-3.94) were the only factors independently associated with falls in the last year.\nQuestion: Does [ Prevalence and associated factors of fall in community-dwelling elderly ]?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Mast cells are tissue-resident immune sentinels that are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory joint disease. The aim of this study was to test our hypothesis that complement fragments could be key activators of synovial mast cells in autoimmune arthritis.\nIn vivo studies used the murine K/BxN arthritis model, a distal symmetric polyarthritis mediated by IgG immune complexes. Expression of C5aR on synovial mast cells was determined by immunohistochemical and functional studies. C5aR(-/-) and control mast cells were engrafted into mast cell-deficient WBB6 F1-Kit(w) /Kit(W-v) (W/Wv) mice to examine the requirement for this receptor in arthritis. C5aR-dependent activation of mast cells was investigated in C5aR(-/-) animals and in murine and human mast cell cultures.\nMurine synovial mast cells express functional C5aR. Unlike their wild-type counterparts, C5aR(-/-) mast cells adoptively transferred into W/Wv mice were not competent to restore arthritis, despite equivalent synovial engraftment. Activation of C5aR(-/-) mast cells by K/BxN serum in vivo remained intact, indicating that C5aR is dispensable for normal IgG-mediated triggering. Consistent with this result, cultured mast cells treated with C5a failed to modulate the expression of Fcγ receptors (FcγR) or to otherwise alter the activation threshold. In human mast cells, C5a promoted the production of the neutrophil chemotaxin interleukin-8, and recruitment of neutrophils at 24 hours after serum administration was impaired in C5aR(-/-) mice, suggesting that enhanced neutrophil chemoattractant production underlies the requirement for C5aR on mast cells in arthritis.\nQuestion: Does c5a receptor enable participation of mast cells in immune complex arthritis independently of Fcγ receptor modulation?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Recent studies have suggested that schizophrenia is associated with alterations in the synaptic connectivity involving cytoskeletal proteins. The microtubule-associated protein stable tubule only polypeptide (STOP) plays a key role in neuronal architecture and synaptic plasticity, and it has been demonstrated that STOP gene deletion in mice leads to a phenotype mimicking aspects of positive and negative symptoms and cognitive deficits classically observed in schizophrenic patients. In STOP null mice, behavioral defects are associated with synaptic plasticity abnormalities including defects in long-term potentiation. In these mice, long-term administration of typical antipsychotics has been shown to partially alleviate behavioral defects but, as in humans, such a treatment was poorly active on deficits related to negative symptoms and cognitive impairments. Here, we assessed the effects of risperidone and clozapine, two atypical antipsychotics, on STOP null mice behavior and synaptic plasticity.\nLong-term administration of either drug results in alleviation of behavioral alterations mimicking some negative symptoms and partial amelioration of some cognitive defects in STOP null mice. Interestingly, clozapine treatment also improves synaptic plasticity of the STOP null animals by restoring long-term potentiation in the hippocampus.\nQuestion: Does chronic administration of atypical antipsychotics improve behavioral and synaptic defects of STOP null mice?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To evaluate the effects of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) on intestinal adaptation after resection of 85% of the small intestine and consider its potential application in short bowel syndrome (SBS).\nExperimental study using a known model of SBS.\nThirty male Sprague Dawley rats.\nFour groups of animals were designated. Two groups underwent 85% resection of the small intestine, while the other two groups were sham-operated, undergoing transection and reanastomosis. Resected and sham-operated groups then received either 3 mg/kg KGF or vehicle subcutaneously daily for 3 days. Gut adaptation was evaluated by measurements of mucosal cellularity and biochemical activity in duodenal, jejunal, and ileal segments.\nSignificant small intestinal growth after bowel resection alone was confirmed in resected versus sham-operated rats. KGF further augmented this growth in the resected animals. Mucosal wet weight of the small intestine increased with resection and was further increased (by 20% or more) with KGF administration. Mucosal thickness, villus length, and crypt depth exhibited similar patterns of response. The KGF-induced increase in mucosal morphology was accompanied by increased mucosal DNA and protein content, followed by a trend toward increased mucosal enzyme activity. Histology demonstrated an increase in goblet cells in KGF-treated animals. In situ hybridization analysis demonstrated that KGF markedly increased mucosal expression of intestinal trefoil protein (ITF) mRNA.\nQuestion: Does keratinocyte growth factor enhance early gut adaptation in a rat model of short bowel syndrome?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Animal studies have suggested dramatic improvement in cardiac function after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) through regeneration of the myocardium or neovascularization by transfer of cells derived from bone marrow (BMC) generated clinical studies. Recently published small sized studies have yielded mixed results, leaving the question unanswered.\nWe analyzed data from these studies in a meta-analysis to investigate if intracoronary stem cell therapy was effective in improving cardiac function.\nA total of 7 randomized controlled trials meeting the inclusion criteria were identified by a systematic literature search. Primary endpoint was change in global left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) baseline to follow-up (ranging between 3 to 6 months). The meta-analysis consisted of 516 patients (BMC group, 256; control group, 260). A 2-sided alpha error of less than .05 was considered to be statistically significant (P<.05).\nThere were no significant differences in patient characteristics between the BMC treatment and control groups at baseline. Compared to the control group, patients in the BMC treatment group had significantly greater increase in LVEF from baseline to follow-up (mean difference: 6.108%; SE: 1.753%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.672%- 9.543%; P<.001).\nQuestion: Do stem cells improve left ventricular function in acute myocardial infarction?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Recently, microRNAs (miRNAs) have taken centre stage in the field of human molecular oncology. Several studies have shown that miRNA profiling analyses offer new possibilities in cancer classification, diagnosis and prognosis. However, the function of miRNAs that are dysregulated in tumours remains largely a mystery. Global analysis of miRNA-target gene expression has helped illuminate the role of miRNAs in developmental gene expression programs, but such an approach has not been reported in cancer transcriptomics.\nIn this study, we globally analysed the expression patterns of miRNA target genes in prostate cancer by using several public microarray datasets. Intriguingly, we found that, in contrast to global mRNA transcript levels, putative miRNA targets showed a reduced abundance in prostate tumours relative to benign prostate tissue. Additionally, the down-regulation of these miRNA targets positively correlated with the number of types of miRNA target-sites in the 3' untranslated regions of these targets. Further investigation revealed that the globally low expression was mainly driven by the targets of 36 specific miRNAs that were reported to be up-regulated in prostate cancer by a miRNA expression profiling study. We also found that the transcript levels of miRNA targets were lower in androgen-independent prostate cancer than in androgen-dependent prostate cancer. Moreover, when the global analysis was extended to four other cancers, significant differences in transcript levels between miRNA targets and total mRNA backgrounds were found.\nQuestion: Does global gene expression analysis reveal reduced abundance of putative microRNA targets in human prostate tumours?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: A vaccine for Chlamydia trachomatis is of urgent medical need. We explored bioinformatic approaches to generate an immunogen against C. trachomatis that would induce cross-serovar T-cell responses as (i) CD4(+) T cells have been shown in animal models and human studies to be important in chlamydial protection and (ii) antibody responses may be restrictive and serovar specific.\nA consensus antigen based on over 1,500 major outer membrane protein (MOMP) sequences provided high epitope coverage against the most prevalent C. trachomatis strains in silico. Having designed the T-cell immunogen, we assessed it for immunogenicity in prime-boost regimens. This consensus MOMP transgene was delivered using plasmid DNA, Human Adenovirus 5 (HuAd5) or modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) vectors with or without MF59(®) adjuvanted recombinant MOMP protein.\nDifferent regimens induced distinct immune profiles. The DNA-HuAd5-MVA-Protein vaccine regimen induced a cellular response with a Th1-biased serum antibody response, alongside high serum and vaginal MOMP-specific antibodies. This regimen significantly enhanced clearance against intravaginal C. trachomatis serovar D infection in both BALB/c and B6C3F1 mouse strains. This enhanced clearance was shown to be CD4(+) T-cell dependent. Future studies will need to confirm the specificity and precise mechanisms of protection.\nQuestion: Does a Multi-Component Prime-Boost Vaccination Regimen with a Consensus MOMP Antigen enhance Chlamydia trachomatis Clearance?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Periodontal disease has been associated with cardiovascular disorders with an atherosclerotic background, and number of teeth (NT) has been suggested as a possible risk indicator for cardiovascular disease. The objective of this study is to investigate whether NT was related to the intima-media thickness (IMT) and to atherosclerotic plaque in carotid arteries in an elderly population.\nIn a population-based study including 1,016 participants aged 70 years, the NT was self-reported by 947 of the participants. Carotid artery IMT was evaluated by ultrasound. The occurrence of plaque was also measured. Logistic regression was used to analyze the associations between NT and the number of carotid arteries with plaque.\nA significant inverse relationship was found between the NT and the number of carotid arteries with plaque after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, body mass index, waist/hip ratio, blood glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, C-reactive protein, leukocyte count, blood pressure, and Framingham risk score, with odds ratio of 0.89, 95% confidence interval of 0.82 to 0.98, and P = 0.016. The relationship was fairly linear, suggesting a dose-response relationship. When NT was divided into quintiles using the first one as referent, the relationship persisted for all quintiles except for the second one. However, no relationship to IMT was seen.\nQuestion: Is number of teeth related to atherosclerotic plaque in the carotid arteries in an elderly population?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Afamin is a human plasma vitamin E-binding glycoprotein primarily expressed in the liver and secreted into the bloodstream. Because little is known about (patho)-physiological functions of afamin, we decided to identify phenotypes associated with afamin by investigating transgenic mice overexpressing the human afamin gene and performing large-scale human epidemiological studies.\nTransgenic mice overexpressing afamin revealed increased body weight and serum concentrations of lipids and glucose. We applied a random-effects meta-analysis using age- and sex-adjusted baseline and follow-up investigations in the population-based Bruneck (n=826), Salzburg Atherosclerosis Prevention Program in Subjects at High Individual Risk (SAPHIR; n=1499), and KOoperative Gesundheitsforschung in der Region Augsburg (KORA) F4 studies (n=3060). Mean afamin concentrations were 62.5±15.3, 66.2±14.3, and 70.6±17.2 mg/L in Bruneck, SAPHIR, and KORA F4, respectively. Per 10 mg/L increment in afamin measured at baseline, the number of metabolic syndrome components increased by 19% (incidence rate ratio=1.19; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.16-1.21; P=5.62×10(-64)). With the same afamin increment used at baseline, we observed an 8% gain in metabolic syndrome components between baseline and follow-up (incidence rate ratio=1.08; 95% CI, 1.06-1.10; P=8.87×10(-16)). Afamin concentrations at baseline were highly significantly related to all individual metabolic syndrome components at baseline and at follow-up. This observation was most pronounced for elevated waist circumference (odds ratio, 1.79; 95% CI, 1.54-2.09; P=4.15×10(-14) at baseline and odds ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.31-1.63; P=2.84×10(-11) for change during follow-up) and for elevated fasting glucose concentrations (odds ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.40-1.52; P=1.87×10(-69) and odds ratio, 1.46; 95% CI, 1.24-1.71; P=5.13×10(-6), respectively).\nQuestion: Are plasma concentrations of afamin associated with the prevalence and development of metabolic syndrome?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To investigate the relationship between cysteine-rich protein 61 (Cyr61) and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signal pathway on cell proliferation and apoptotic in human ovarian carcinoma cells.\nRecombinant human Cyr61 (rhCyr61) was pretreated with ovarian carcinoma cells. The expression of Cyr61 protein was detected by confocal spectral microscopy. Then treated the ovarian carcinoma cells with PI3K transduction inhibitors (LY294002) for 24 hours. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry (FCM). Cell viability was determined by methyl thiazolyl tetrazolium (MTT) method. The mRNA expressions of Cyr61, the protein levels of protein kinase B (PKB), phospho-PKB and Cyr61 were assayed by real time-PCR and western blot analysis, respectively.\nThe Cyr61 and phospho-PKB protein expression in two ovarian carcinoma cells (OV2008 and OVCAR-3) were increased in rhCyr61 pretreated group. The decreasing of cell apoptosis [(1.4 ± 0.9)%, (2.1 ± 1.0)%] and increasing of cell proliferation [(124.0 ± 1.8)%, (133.0 ± 2.2)%] was detected in the same time, compared with negative control group, there were significant difference (P < 0.05). After exposed to LY294002 for 24 hours, the apoptosis rate of OV2008 and OVCAR-3 in pretreated with rhCyr61 group exposed to LY294002 were (21.1 ± 1.6)% and (26.4 ± 1.5)%, respectively. Cells viability [(59.0 ± 2.3)%, (51.0 ± 2.0)%] was also significantly decreased in OV2008 and OVCAR-3 pretreated with rhCyr61 cells. Meanwhile, the mRNA expressions of Cyr61 (3.2 ± 0.8, 6.2 ± 1.1) and the protein levels of phospho-PKB and Cyr61 were greatly decreased. Compared with negative control group, there were significant difference in OV2008 and OVCAR-3 cells (all P < 0.01).\nQuestion: Does [ Cyr61 expression influence cancer cell proliferation and apoptosis via PI3K pathway in human ovarian carcinoma cells ]?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: SHOX2 (short stature homeobox 2) is a crucial transcriptional regulator in several genetic disorders and has been demonstrated to be an excellent biomarker in the diagnosis and evaluation of lung cancer. However, its expression pattern and prognostic value for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are still unknown.\nExpression of SHOX2 gene and protein in HCC tissues and cell lines were evaluated by RT-qPCR and western blot. Impact of RNAi-mediated SHOX2 silence on the proliferation and invasion ability of Huh7 cell line in vitro was determined by CCK-8 assay and matrigel invasion assay, respectively.\nElevated expression of SHOX2 gene was significantly associated with higher incidence of tumor recurrence (n = 60, p = 0.001), absence of tumor capsule (p = 0.015), presence of tumor thrombi (p < 0.0001), and advanced TNM stage (p < 0.0001) of HCC. SHOX2 protein expression was more abundant in HCC cell lines compared with hepatic cell line (p = 0.001), which was associated with tumor recurrence (n = 40, p = 0.046). RNAi-mediated silence of SHOX2 expression significantly inhibited the proliferation (p < 0.001) and invasion (p = 0.006) of Huh7 cell line in vitro.\nQuestion: Is elevated SHOX2 expression associated with tumor recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO) is a modulator of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and myocardial relaxation. The impact of NO availability on development of LVH has never been demonstrated in humans. We tested the hypotheses that elevation of asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) concentrations (biochemical marker of decreased NO generation), and impairment of vascular responsiveness to NO donor GTN, would each predict the presence of LVH and associated LV diastolic dysfunction in a normal aging population.\nIn 74 subjects aged 68±6 years, LV volumes and mass indexed to height(2.7) (LVMI) were calculated from cardiac MRI. Despite the absence of clinically-defined LVH, there was a relationship (r=0.29; p=0.01) between systolic BP and LVMI. Both elevation of ADMA levels to the highest quartile or impairment of GTN responsiveness (determined by applanation tonometry) to the lowest quartile were determinants of LVMI independent of systolic BP (p=0.01 and p=0.03, respectively). Filling pressure (E/E' ratio from echocardiography) was increased in patients with impaired vascular NO responsiveness (p<0.05) irrespective of LVMI. ADMA remained a significant determinant of LVMI on multivariate analysis.\nQuestion: Does the endogenous NOS inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine ( ADMA ) predict LV mass independent of afterload?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Transplantation of allogeneic donor bone marrow (BM) into sufficiently conditioned recipients is an effective approach to induce immune tolerance as assessed by mixed chimerism. However, this approach is hampered by the lack of feasible protocols devoid of cytoreductive conditioning. We investigated whether mixed chimerism could be established by intra-bone marrow-bone marrow transplantation (IBM-BMT) combined with bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) treatment without additional cytoreductive conditioning.\nThe recipient mice (C57BL/6) accepted BMSCs from donor mice (Balb/c) through daily tail vein injection for 4 d followed by IBM-BMT immediately. Full-thickness skin grafts from donor mice as well as from the third party mice (ICR) were transplanted to the dorsum of the recipient mice after the combined IBM-BMT with BMSCs treatment. The immune tolerance was assessed by the survival time of skin allografts. The establishment of mixed chimerism and cytokine expression profile in recipient peripheral blood were determined by flow cytometry and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, respectively.\nIBM-BMT combined with BMSCs treatment led to stable mixed chimerism and donor-specific skin graft tolerance. The flow cytometry analysis revealed that recipient mice developed 20%-25% chimerism levels among the myeloid lineage. The skin allografts survived more than 1 y and the hair re-grew normally on the grafts. Cytokine profile showed that IBM-BMT combined with BMSCs treatment prolonged humoral tolerance in recipient chimeras.\nQuestion: Does bone marrow transplantation combined with mesenchymal stem cells induce immune tolerance without cytotoxic conditioning?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Breast milk has been shown to be associated with greater success with regard to weaning children with intestinal failure off parenteral nutrition (PN). There are only a few studies investigating the role of breast milk in decreasing PN-associated liver disease (PNALD). The aim of our study was to determine whether breast milk is better than formula milk in preventing PNALD in infants receiving PN for >4 weeks.\nWe conducted a retrospective analysis of newborns requiring prolonged parenteral nutrition. We divided the sample into 3 different groups (exclusive breast-feeding, exclusive formula-feeding, and mixed feeding. We compared baseline characteristics, feeding profiles and liver function tests, and liver enzymes among the 3 groups.\nAmong infants receiving PN for >4 weeks, we found that infants who were fed only breast milk were significantly less likely to develop PNALD (34.6%) compared with those who were fed only formula milk (72.7%; P = 0.008). The mean maximum conjugated bilirubin (P = 0.03) and the mean maximum aspartate aminotransferase were significantly lower in the breast-fed group (P = 0.04) compared with the formula-fed group. Among the mixed-feeding group, infants who received a higher percentage of breast milk showed a significant negative correlation with the mean maximum conjugated bilirubin. (Pearson correlation -0.517, P = 0.027). The mean number of days receiving PN and the average daily lipid intake in the 2 groups was not significantly different.\nQuestion: Is breast milk better than formula milk in preventing parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease in infants receiving prolonged parenteral nutrition?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: The effects of positive- and negative peer modelling on children's consumption of a novel blue food, presented in each of four snack meals during an \"activity\" day, were evaluated. It was predicted that: (i) novel food consumption would increase after positive modelling, but decrease after negative modelling; (ii) modelling effects would generalise to a second novel blue food when participants were alone when they ate their snack; (iii) that positive modelling would reverse the effects of negative modelling.\nA mixed design was employed with random assignment to either Groups A, B, or C (equal numbers of males and females per group). Within groups, each participant received the novel food on four snack occasions. Group A received positive modelling of blue food consumption on the first and third occasions, but were alone when they received the foods on the second and fourth occasions; Group B had negative modelling on the first occasion, positive modelling on the third, and ate alone on the second and fourth; Group C ate alone on all four occasions. To measure generalisation, an additional blue food was presented in all second and fourth \"alone\" occasions.\nThirty-five 5-7-year olds took part in Study 1, and 44 3-4-year olds in Study 2.\nAll main predictions were confirmed except that positive peer modelling did not reverse the effects of negative modelling in the 3-4-year olds.\nQuestion: Do positive- and negative peer modelling effects on young children 's consumption of novel blue foods?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Many studies have demonstrated that repeated injections of nicotine can produce progressive increases in locomotor activity and enhanced expression of c-fos and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in brain dopaminergic areas. Paecilomyces japonica (PJ) is a herbal medicine that is commonly used to treat opiate and other addictions in Eastern Asia. However, its influence on nicotine addiction has not been examined. This study was carried out to investigate the effects of PJ on repeated nicotine-induced behavioral sensitization of locomotor activity and c-Fos and TH expression in the rat brain using immunohistochemistry.\nRats were pretreated with PJ (10, 25, 50, 100, and 200 mg/kg, intraperitoneally) 30 min before repeated injections of nicotine (0.4 mg/kg, subcutaneously, twice daily for 7 days). Locomotor activity was measured in rats during 7-day nicotine treatments. On the seventh day, c-Fos and TH expression were assessed.\nPretreatment with PJ decreased the development of nicotine-induced sensitization, c-Fos expression in the nucleus accumbens and striatum, and TH expression in the ventral tegmental area. PJ decreased nicotine-induced locomotor activity by modulating brain dopaminergic systems.\nQuestion: Does paecilomycies japonica reduce repeated nicotine-induced neuronal and behavioral activation in rats?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To investigate the effects of cold acclimation on the thermal response and neuromuscular function of the hand.\nTen healthy subjects [three female, seven male, age (mean +/- SD): 27.9 +/- 7.9 years] immersed their right hand in 8 degrees C water for 30 min, 5 days a week for 3 weeks. On the first and the last day, neuromuscular function of the first dorsal interosseus (FDI) muscle was tested.\nThere was no significant change in maximal voluntary contraction strength or evoked contractile characteristics of the FDI after cold acclimation. Minimum finger temperature decreased significantly from 10.6 +/- 1.2 to 9.3 +/- 0.8 degrees C after 3 weeks (P < 0.01), with most of the decrease occurring after a single exposure. Mean finger temperature dropped significantly from 14.2 +/- 1.9 to 11.7 +/- 1.4 degrees C following cold acclimation (P < 0.05), with 90% of this adaptation occurring after 5 days. Onset time of cold-induced vasodilatation increased from 446 +/- 171 to 736 +/- 384 s (P < 0.05) and the amplitude decreased from 5.3 +/- 3.2 to 2.5 +/- 2.1 degrees C (P < 0.05). This was significantly different from the control group, who immersed their right hand on the first and last days only.\nQuestion: Does local cold acclimation of the hand impair thermal responses of the finger without improving hand neuromuscular function?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: A model of independent, external review of significant event analysis by trained peers was introduced by NHS Scotland in 1998 to support the learning needs of general practitioners (GPs). Engagement with this feedback model has increased over time, but participants' views and experiences are largely unknown and there is limited evidence of its educational impact. This is important if external feedback is to play a potential role in appraisal and future revalidation.\nThe study aimed to explore aspects of the acceptability and educational impact of this external feedback model with participating GPs.\nSemi-structured interviews were carried out with nine GPs. Participants were sampled to reflect their level of learning need (low, moderate or high) to gain a range of views and experiences. Transcribed interviews were analysed for content.\nThis system of external peer feedback is generally acceptable to participants. It complemented and enhanced the appraisal process. External feedback had positive educational outcomes, particularly in imparting technical knowledge on how to analyse significant events. Training issues for peer reviewers were suggested that would further enhance the educational gain from participation. There was disagreement over whether this type of feedback could or should be used as supporting evidence of the quality of doctors' work to educational and regulatory authorities.\nQuestion: Do acceptability and educational impact of a peer feedback model for significant event analysis?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To investigate the ability of electromagnetic (EM) field pre-exposures to induce protection in chick embryos against subsequent ultraviolet (UV) light exposure.\nChick embryos in the 4th day of gestation were exposed for 20 minutes (short term) or 96 hours (long term) to 60 Hz, 8 microT magnetic or sham fields (controls) followed by 30 minutes rest. They were then exposed to UV radiation of either low (30J/m2) or high (45J/m2) intensity (long term was exposed only to 30J/m2) for 75 minutes. Mortality measurements were made every 30 minutes following UV exposure.\nAt both UV intensities, short-term, EM field-exposed embryos showed significantly higher post-UV survival (p<0.05) at each time point as compared to controls. Long-term EM field exposures, however, offered no protection against low intensity UV light, in fact, 96 hour-EM field-exposed embryos were significantly less protected than non-EM field-exposed controls (p<0.05).\nQuestion: Do short-term magnetic field exposures ( 60 Hz ) induce protection against ultraviolet radiation damage?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: The identification of signals critical for the pathophysiology of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) should contribute to the development of novel, more effective therapeutic strategies. Common gamma-chain signaling cytokines (gammac-cytokines) - interleukins 2, 4, 7, 9 and 15 - differentially regulate T-cell development, survival, proliferation and differentiation. Although studies exist on some individual cytokines, no comprehensive analysis of the effects of the Zc-cytokine family on malignant T cells has been reported. Here, we examined the effect of Zc-cytokines on T-ALL proliferation.\nPrimary leukemic cells were collected at diagnosis from the blood or bone marrow of children with T-ALL. The cells were immunophenotyped and classified according to maturation stage. Proliferative responses to gammac-cytokines were assessed by 3H-thymidine incorporation.\nAll gammac-cytokines promoted proliferation of primary T-ALL cells. Interleukin (IL)-7 was the cytokine that most frequently induced leukemic cell proliferation and promoted the most robust responses. IL-4 preferentially stimulated proliferation of samples with a more mature immunophenotype, whereas CD1a-positive cortical T-ALL cells were less responsive to IL-9. Finally, combinations of two Zc-cytokines showed synergistic or additive proliferative effects.\nQuestion: Do common gamma chain-signaling cytokines promote proliferation of T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To attempt to predict the success rate of sildenafil citrate in erectile dysfunction patients using penile Doppler ultrasonography (PDU) measurements of peak arterial velocity and end diastolic velocity.\nA total of 212 patients (age range 27-76 years) with vascular pathologies were included in the study. Following a PDU test, the patients were divided into arterial insufficiency, veno-occlusive dysfunction and mixed vascular pathology groups. Subsequently, patients were given sildenafil citrate 50 mg and re-evaluated 1 month later to determine its efficacy. If it was ineffective, the dose was increased to 100 mg and patients were reassessed. Arterial insufficiency and veno-occlusive dysfunction patients were classified into mild, moderate and severe groups depending on peak systolic and end diastolic velocities.\nThe overall response rate in patients with arterial insufficiency was 74.5%, regardless of the degree of arterial insufficiency or the dose of sildenafil. The severe arterial insufficiency group had a much better response to 100 mg compared to 50 mg doses of sildenafil. Although the 50 mg sildenafil dose was effective in patients with minimal veno-occlusive dysfunction, 100 mg was better than 50 mg to achieve adequate erection in the mild and severe veno-occlusive dysfunction groups.\nQuestion: Does a classification based on peak systolic velocity and end diastolic velocity predict sildenafil citrate success?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Thyroid hormone (TH) is essential for the developing brain, and because the fetal thyroid develops relatively late in gestation, the maternal TH supply is critical for fetal brain development. However, if the mother has hypothyroidism during pregnancy, fetal brain and neuropsychological development may be compromised. Rodents experiencing maternal TH insufficiency show abnormal corpus callosum (CC) morphology, but it is not known if children born to women treated for hypothyroidism (HYPO) show similar effects. The purpose of the current study was to investigate HYPO for CC morphology and morphometry and to determine whether any specific CC abnormalities were associated aspects of maternal hypothyroidism and were correlated with reduced neuropsychological functioning in the children.\nANALYZE software was used to trace CCs in archived magnetic resonance imaging scans from 22 HYPO and 22 matched controls. Areas of two sub-regions and six segments and different shape metrics (angles, lengths, ratios) were determined. CC parameters were correlated with maternal thyrotropin (TSH) values and number of hypothyroid trimesters as well as the child's neuropsychological test performance.\nHYPO showed a smaller anterior CC and genu and larger posterior CC and splenium areas than controls as well as shape abnormalities in genu and splenium. Results were correlated with the duration of maternal hypothyroidism. Executive function skills were positively associated with genu size in HYPO, while verbal comprehension skills were negatively associated with splenium and overall posterior CC sizes.\nQuestion: Do children born to women treated for hypothyroidism during pregnancy show abnormal corpus callosum development?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Under physiological conditions the blood flow velocity waveform in the umbilical vein (UV) has an even non-pulsating pattern. Pulsations in the UV have been described in human fetuses exposed to chronic hypoxia and heart failure. Current techniques for fetal surveillance during labor and delivery involve a risk of both over- and underestimation of fetal hypoxia. We aimed to examine whether pulsations in the UV appear in the human fetus during suspected intrapartum hypoxia, and if so whether they are associated with increased risk of operative delivery for fetal distress (ODFD).\nThis was a prospective double blind study including 52 normal pregnancies. A Doppler examination of the UV was performed on 26 fetuses with pathological and 26 fetuses with normal cardiotocography (CTG) during labor. Presence or absence of pulsations in the UV were noted and related to perinatal outcome.\nPulsations in the UV were seen in eight (30.8%) of the fetuses with pathological CTG, of which six (75%) underwent ODFD. No pulsations were seen in the other 18 (69.2%) fetuses with pathological CTG and these were all delivered without ODFD. No pulsations were seen in the UV in the fetuses with normal CTG and these were all delivered without ODFD. Among the fetuses with pathological CTG, there was an increased risk of ODFD in fetuses with vs. those without pulsations in the UV (P < 0.0001).\nQuestion: Are pulsations in the umbilical vein during labor associated with increased risk of operative delivery for fetal distress?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Radiotherapy for biochemical prostate cancer recurrence after prostatectomy achieves durable salvage rates of only 40% to 50%. Improved methods of identifying patients unlikely to benefit from salvage radiotherapy are needed. Altered expression of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin may be associated with the invasive and metastatic phenotype. We examined the relationship between E-cadherin expression and outcomes after salvage radiotherapy.\nE-cadherin expression was examined by immunohistochemistical analysis of a tissue microarray of prostatectomy tissues from patients who underwent salvage radiotherapy. The relation between E-cadherin staining, other risk factors and biochemical failure after salvage radiotherapy was analyzed using Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression methods.\nOf 37 analyzable cases 25 showed aberrant E-cadherin expression, while the remainder had normal expression. At a median clinical followup of 40 months univariate analysis demonstrated that E-cadherin staining was not associated with Gleason score, extracapsular extension, surgical margin status, pre-prostatectomy or pre-radiotherapy prostate specific antigen, complete biochemical response after radiotherapy or adjunctive hormonal therapy but it was associated with seminal vesicle invasion. Two-year failure-free survival was 55% in patients with aberrant E-cadherin expression compared with 92% in patients with normal E-cadherin expression (p = 0.02). Multivariate analysis confirmed that aberrant E-cadherin expression was associated with salvage radiotherapy failure (p = 0.03).\nQuestion: Does e-cadherin protein expression predict prostate cancer salvage radiotherapy outcomes?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Since intestinal epithelium expresses Toll-like receptors, it was suggested that the intestinal epithelium is actively involved in the maintenance of colonic homeostasis. Here we describe our recent findings, which support an active contribution of colonic epithelium to intestinal homeostasis via a unique activation of epithelial TLR9.\nRecent data indicate that stimulation of Toll-like receptors by intestinal microbiota supports colonic homeostasis. Several Toll-like receptors are expressed in intestinal epithelium. TLR9, an intracellular protein in immune cells, is expressed on the cell surfaces of intestinal epithelium, both on the apical and the basolateral membrane. TLR9 signaling varies in a domain-specific manner; whereas JNK is activated by TLR9 ligand both apically or basolaterally, NF-kappaB is activated only via basolateral stimulation. In apical TLR9 stimulation, IkappaB is phosphorylated and ubiquitinated but is not degraded, and NF-kappaB-dependent inflammatory signals are not transduced. Stimulation of apical TLR9 compromises the inflammatory cascade induced basolaterally by several other Toll-like receptor ligands, suggesting that apical exposure to luminal microbial DNA restrains intestinal inflammation.\nQuestion: Does toll-like receptor signaling in intestinal epithelial cells contribute to colonic homoeostasis?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Following damage to the intestinal epithelium, restoration of epithelial barrier integrity is triggered by a robust proliferative response. In other tissues, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) regulates many of the cellular processes that are critical for epithelial homeostasis and restitution, including cell migration, proliferation and survival. However, few studies to date have determined how FAK contributes to mucosal wound healing in vivo.\nTo examine the role of FAK in intestinal epithelial homeostasis and during injury, we generated intestinal epithelium (IE)-specific conditional FAK knockout mice. Colitis was induced with dextran-sulfate-sodium (DSS) and intestinal tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. While intestinal development occurred normally in mice lacking FAK, FAK-deficient animals were profoundly susceptible to colitis. The loss of epithelial FAK resulted in elevated p53 expression and an increased sensitivity to apoptosis, coincident with a failure to upregulate epithelial cell proliferation. FAK has been reported to function as a mechanosensor, inducing cyclin D1 expression and promoting cell cycle progression under conditions in which tissue/matrix stiffness is increased. Collagen deposition, a hallmark of inflammatory injury resulting in increased tissue rigidity, was observed in control and FAK knockout mice during colitis. Despite this fibrotic response, the colonic epithelium in FAK-deficient mice exhibited significantly reduced cyclin D1 expression, suggesting that proliferation is uncoupled from fibrosis in the absence of FAK. In support of this hypothesis, proliferation of Caco-2 cells increased proportionally with matrix stiffness in vitro only under conditions of normal FAK expression; FAK depleted cells exhibited reduced proliferation concomitant with attenuated cyclin D1 expression.\nQuestion: Does fAK regulate intestinal epithelial cell survival and proliferation during mucosal wound healing?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Clinical observations and in vitro experimental data indicate that females have a longer QT interval than males, which is associated with a higher risk of drug-induced cardiac arrhythmias. Little is known about this gender difference in anesthetized animals, which may affect the outcome of in vivo drug tests.\nWe evaluated potential gender differences in ventricular repolarization (QT, QTc, JT, and JTc interval) and its dispersion, as well as in its response to dofetilide, an IKr blocker, in anesthetized rabbits challenged with the alpha1-adrenoceptor agonist methoxamine. A 12-lead ECG was recorded during the experiments. At baseline, there were no significant gender differences in ventricular repolarization values in male and female rabbits under anesthesia. Dofetilide (0.04 mg/kg/min IV for 60 min; n = 10 per gender) produced marked prolongation of the ventricular repolarization time and its dispersion, associated with a high incidence of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (PVT; 100% in females vs 80% in males) and ventricular fibrillation (VF; 80% in females vs 50% in males; P > 0.05). QT and JT interval at 2 minutes as well as QT and JT dispersion at 10 and 30 minutes during dofetilide infusion were significantly higher in female than in male rabbits. After 30 minutes of dofetilide infusion, 10 of 10 female rabbits had severe cardiac arrhythmias (complete AV block, PVT, or VF), so ECG parameters were impossible to assess (vs 3/10 males with severe cardiac arrhythmias; P < 0.05). During dofetilide infusion, female rabbits developed complete AV block, PVT, or VF at doses about 50% lower than those given to males.\nQuestion: Is female gender a risk factor for drug-induced long QT and cardiac arrhythmias in an in vivo rabbit model?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: This investigation evaluated extrinsic stain removal efficacy after brushing for one and two weeks with a commercially available fluoride dentifrice relative to Colgate Total Advanced Clean, a new dentifrice formulated with dual-phase silica.\nAt the baseline visit, one-hundred and forty-four adult subjects were stratified by Lobene Stain Index scores and randomized to two treatment groups using either Total Advanced Clean dentifrice (0.3% triclosan, 2% copolymer, dual phase silica) or a commercially available fluoride dentifrice, and instructed to brush twice daily. Tooth stain evaluations were conducted on stain area, stain intensity, and a composite score of both, after one and two weeks of dentifrice use.\nBaseline scores demonstrated no significant differences between the two treatment groups for all evaluated stain parameters (p > 0.05). At both the one- and two-week post-use evaluations, subjects brushing with Total Advanced Clean demonstrated significant reductions for all stain parameters versus the control (p < 0.05). The Total Advanced Clean group demonstrated mean reductions in stain intensity of 0.37 and 0.74 at the one- and two-week evaluations, respectively, versus the control group. Corresponding mean reductions in stain area for the Total Advanced Clean group versus the control were 0.12 and 0.24 at the one- and two-week evaluations, respectively. The two post-use evaluations also demonstrated significant reductions in stain composite scores for the subjects assigned Total Advanced Clean (p < 0.0001).\nQuestion: Do clinical stain removal efficacy of two dentifrices after one and two weeks of use?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Celastrol is one of several bioactive compounds extracted from the medicinal plant Tripterygium wilfordii. Celastrol is used to treat inflammatory conditions, and shows benefits in models of neurodegenerative disease, cancer and arthritis, although its mechanism of action is incompletely understood.\nCelastrol was tested on human NADPH oxidases (NOXs) using a panel of experiments: production of reactive oxygen species and oxygen consumption by NOX enzymes, xanthine oxidase activity, cell toxicity, phagocyte oxidase subunit translocation, and binding to cytosolic subunits of NOX enzymes. The effect of celastrol was compared with diphenyleneiodonium, an established inhibitor of flavoproteins.\nLow concentrations of celastrol completely inhibited NOX1, NOX2, NOX4 and NOX5 within minutes with concentration-response curves exhibiting higher Hill coefficients and lower IC₅₀ values for NOX1 and NOX2 compared with NOX4 and NOX5, suggesting differences in their mode of action. In a cell-free system, celastrol had an IC₅₀ of 1.24 and 8.4 µM for NOX2 and NOX5, respectively. Cytotoxicity, oxidant scavenging, and inhibition of p47(phox) translocation could not account for NOX inhibition. Celastrol bound to a recombinant p47(phox) and disrupted the binding of the proline rich region of p22(phox) to the tandem SH3 domain of p47(phox) and NOXO1, the cytosolic subunits of NOX2 and NOX1, respectively.\nQuestion: Are nADPH oxidase ( NOX ) isoforms inhibited by celastrol with a dual mode of action?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: While LINE1 (L1) retroelements comprise nearly 20% of the human genome, the majority are thought to have been rendered transcriptionally inactive, due to either mutation or epigenetic suppression. How many L1 elements 'escape' these forms of repression and contribute to the transcriptome of human somatic cells? We have cloned out expressed sequence tags corresponding to the 5' and 3' flanks of L1 elements in order to characterize the population of elements that are being actively transcribed. We also examined expression of a select number of elements in different individuals.\nWe isolated expressed sequence tags from human lymphoblastoid cell lines corresponding to 692 distinct L1 element sites, including 410 full-length elements. Four of the expression tagged sites corresponding to full-length elements from the human specific L1Hs subfamily were examined in European-American individuals and found to be differentially expressed in different family members.\nQuestion: Do many LINE1 elements contribute to the transcriptome of human somatic cells?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: The steroid ouabain is found in plasma and in many mammalian tissues, and is now considered as a hormone. In the immune system, ouabain regulates a number of lymphocyte functions, but little is known about its effects on monocyte function. Monocytes are important for adequate immune responses. The aim of this work was to analyze the effect of ouabain on mCD14 expression, a surface molecule involved in the response against Gram-negative bacteria and phagocytosis.\nHuman peripheral blood mononuclear cells obtained from healthy donors were separated by density gradient centrifugation. Monocytes were separated by adherence and treated for 24 h with 100 nM ouabain. mCD14, CD1a and P-p38 expression was analyzed by flow cytometry. Inhibitors of cell-signaling pathways, i.e. SB202190, reduced glutathione, rottlerin, tyrphostin A23, genistein, chelerythrine chloride, PD98059, PP1 and Ly 294002, were used concomitantly with ouabain to observe their effect on mCD14 expression.\nOuabain induced a significant decrease in mCD14 expression. This feature was not related to receptor endocytosis or cell death. Furthermore, mCD14 downregulation did not reflect a shift in differentiation into dendritic cells because this hormone failed to induce CD1a expression. Amongst several inhibitors of cell-signaling pathways triggered by ouabain, only epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) inhibitors (tyrphostin A23 and SB202109) significantly reverted the effect of ouabain on mCD14 expression. Accordingly, the levels of P-p38 were increased on monocytes after ouabain treatment. However, incubation with epidermal growth factor did not alter mCD14 expression.\nQuestion: Is mCD14 expression in human monocytes downregulated by ouabain via transactivation of epithelial growth factor receptor and activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: The pharmacokinetics (PKs) and pharmacodynamics (PDs) of telmisartan varies among the individuals, and the main causes remain unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of ORM1, as well as ABCC2, ABCB1, ABCG2 and SLCO1B3 polymorphisms, on the disposition of the drug and BP change after taking 40 mg telmisartan in 48 healthy Chinese males.\nA total of 48 healthy males were included in this trial. Every volunteer ingested a single dose of 40 mg telmisartan, and the plasma drug concentration and blood pressure (BP) were measured up to 48 h.\nIn this study, the area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC) in the heterozygotes of ORM1 113AG was higher than that in the wild-type homozygotes, AUC(0-48) (113AA vs. 113AG, 1,549.18±859.84 ng·h/ml vs. 2,313.54±1,257.71 ng·h/ml, P = 0.033), AUC(0-∞) (113AA vs. 113AG, 1,753.13±1,060.60 ng·h/ml vs. 2,686.90±1,401.87 ng·h/ml, P = 0.016), and the change(%) of the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) from the baseline BP value also showed a significant difference between the ORM1 113AG and 113AA genotypes at 5 h after taking telmisartan (P = 0.026). This study also showed that the allele of ABCC2 C3972T would affected the disposition of telmsiartan and the DBP change significantly after taking the drug. However, the common SNPs of ABCG2 C421, ABCB1 C3435T, and SLCO1B3 T334G showed no impacts on the PKs of telmisartan or BP change(%) in our trial.\nQuestion: Is polymorphism of ORM1 associated with the pharmacokinetics of telmisartan?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Evidence indicates that loads and postures that an individual is exposed to alter their risk of reporting low back pain or incurring a spine injury. In vitro research indicates cyclic flexion under static compressive loads can lead to disc herniation, while repetitive compression in neutral or flexed postures leads to vertebral failure. However, no research has examined the likelihood of altering injury site (disc vs. bone) when dynamic load exposures are varied concurrently with cyclic flexion.\nFifty porcine cervical spinal units were assigned to one of five groups based on peak normalized loads of 10%, 30%, 50%, 70% and 90% of the unit's predicted tolerance. Specimens underwent passive range of motion tests to determine individualized range of motion. Once individualized loads and angles were determined, specimens were cyclically compressed and flexed based on profiles obtained from a floor to waist height lift until failure occurred or 12h elapsed. After testing specimens were dissected to identify injury site, and cumulative exposures sustained to failure were calculated.\nDisc injury was not observed when peak loads exceeded 30% of the tolerance, while they comprised a higher percentage of the total injuries incurred when decreasing from the 30% to 10% groups. Those specimens exhibiting disc injury tolerated significantly greater: cycles to failure (9000 vs. 930, P<0.0001), cumulative compression (10872.7 vs. 1089.5MNs, P<0.001), shear (1822.1 vs. 150.6MNs, P<0.001) and angular excursion (130809.7 degrees vs. 12714.7 degrees , P<0.001).\nQuestion: Is the role of dynamic flexion in spine injury altered by increasing dynamic load magnitude?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: We sought to compare obstetric and perinatal outcomes of singletons born after extended embryo culture and a single blastocyst stage embryo vs a single cleavage stage embryo transfer.\nThis was a retrospective cohort study of 1543 fresh single embryo transfers using nondonor oocytes in women ≤40 years old from December 2008 through December 2012 at the reproductive unit of McGill University Health Center. The main outcome measures were perinatal outcomes including birthweight, low birthweight, small for gestational age, preterm delivery, preeclampsia, placental abruption, and neonatal complications. Covariates were maternal age, body mass index, smoking, cause of infertility, parity, and sex of the baby.\nTransfers of 693 fresh single cleavage embryos and 850 fresh single blastocysts resulting in 564 pregnancies and 381 singleton deliveries were analyzed. Blastocyst transfer resulted in a higher clinical pregnancy rate (50.1% and 19.9%) and live birth rate (33.5% and 13.8%) compared to cleavage embryo transfer, respectively (P < .001). Multivariate analyses for pregnancy revealed no increased risk of maternal or neonatal complications in pregnancies resulting from extended embryo culture.\nQuestion: Is extended embryo culture associated with increased adverse obstetric or perinatal outcome?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Nitric oxide (NO) produced in human airways seems to have both homeostatic and proinflammatory actions in the respiratory system. NO production has been shown to be higher in the exhaled air of asthmatic adults than in normal subjects. The aim of this study was to evaluate exhaled NO production during asthma exacerbation in children and the effect of a rescue course of oral steroid therapy.\nWe measured NO in the exhaled air of 16 children (8 girls and 8 boys, aged 6 to 13 years) with an acute asthmatic episode before and after 5 days of therapy with prednisone, and in 16 healthy children. To measure NO, children inhaled NO-free air and, breathing at tidal volume, exhaled in a circuit from which a chemiluminescence analyzer sampled continuously. To assess the effect of acute changes in bronchial caliber on exhaled NO levels, we measured NO before and after a positive bronchodilation test result with albuterol in seven children with asthma whose disease was stable.\nIn the group with acute asthma (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 62% +/- 4.4% predicted, mean +/- SEM), NO levels were significantly higher (31.3 +/- 4.2 parts per billion [ppb]) than in healthy children (5.4 +/- 0.4 ppb, p < 0.001). Administration of prednisone (1 mg/kg per day orally) for 5 days resulted in a mean decrease of 46% +/- 4% in exhaled NO concentrations (16.5 +/- 2.3 ppb, p < 0.001) compared with baseline, accompanied by a significant improvement in lung function (forced expiratory volume in 1 second 90.7% +/- 4.3% predicted). However, in patients with asthma exhaled NO levels remained significantly higher than in control children (p < 0.001) after steroid treatment. When exhaled NO was measured before and after a positive result after bronchodilator reversibility testing, we found no difference in exhaled NO levels (24 +/- 3.8 ppb vs 23.8 +/- 3 ppb; difference not significant). This demonstrates that inhaled albuterol and acute changes in bronchial caliber do not affect exhaled NO measurement.\nQuestion: Do corticosteroids decrease exhaled nitric oxide in children with acute asthma?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To investigate factors associated with poor nutritional status in older people living in residential care facilities.\n188 residents (136 women, 52 men) with physical and cognitive impairments participated. Mean age was 84.7 y (range 65-100). The Mini Nutritional Assessment (MNA), Barthel ADL Index, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), and Geriatric Depression Scale were used to evaluate nutritional status, activities of daily living, cognitive status and depressive symptoms. Medical conditions, clinical characteristics and prescribed drugs were recorded. Univariate and multivariate regressions were used to investigate associations with MNA scores.\nThe mean MNA score was 20.5 ± 3.7 (range 5.5-27) and the median was 21 (interquartile range (IQR) 18.8-23.0). Fifteen per cent of participants were classified as malnourished and 66% at risk of malnutrition. Lower MNA scores were independently associated with urinary tract infection (UTI) during the preceding year (β = - 0.21, P = 0.006), lower MMSE scores (β = 0.16, P = 0.030), and dependent in feeding (β = - 0.14, P = 0.040).\nQuestion: Is poor nutritional status associated with urinary tract infection among older people living in residential care facilities?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: A recent investigation has documented an increased risk of aneurysm-related complications after endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) of familial abdominal aortic aneurysms (fAAAs). We hypothesized that fAAA patients are not at increased risk for complications following open AAA repair or EVAR when compared with sporadic abdominal aortic aneurysm (spAAA) patients. To this end, we performed a single institution retrospective review.\nEpidemiologic data were collected through the electronic medical record. Family history data were obtained from a questionnaire administered at the initial vascular surgery consultation. Major adverse events were defined as myocardial infarction, respiratory failure, renal failure, bowel ischemia, limb ischemia, multisystem organ failure, intracranial hemorrhage, paraplegia, hemorrhage, or death. Endoleaks were classified in accordance with the standardized reporting practices of the Society for Vascular Surgery. AAA-related complications were defined as the need for a secondary intervention due to endoleak, limb ischemia, or postimplantation rupture.\nA total of 392 patients with complete clinical data underwent elective AAA repair from 2004 to 2014. Of these 392 patients, 89 (23%) were classified as fAAA patients and 303 (77%) were classified as spAAA patients. With the exception of increased rates of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (P = .0009) and pack-years smoked (P = .03) in spAAA patients, demographics did not differ. Sixty-two percent (n = 55) of fAAA patients and 68% (n = 205) of spAAA patients underwent EVAR (P = .30). fAAA patients did not incur any significant difference in major adverse events following open AAA repair (fAAA, 9% vs spAAA, 11%; P = .75). Additionally, fAAA patients did not incur any significant difference in major adverse events following EVAR (fAAA, 4% vs spAAA, 5%; P = .70). Patients with fAAA did have a significantly increased rate of endoleak (fAAA, 24% vs spAAA, 12%; P = .03) and secondary intervention following EVAR (fAAA, 21% vs spAAA, 12%; P = .04).\nQuestion: Are patients with familial abdominal aortic aneurysms at increased risk for endoleak and secondary intervention following elective endovascular aneurysm repair?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Chronic infection with hepatitis B or C virus (HBV or HCV) is a leading cause of cirrhosis by unknown mechanisms of pathogenesis. Translocation of gut microbial products into the systemic circulation might increase because of increased intestinal permeability, bacterial overgrowth, or impaired clearance of microbial products by Kupffer cells. We investigated whether the extent and progression of liver disease in patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection are associated with microbial translocation and subsequent activation of monocytes.\nIn a retrospective study, we analyzed data from 16 patients with minimal fibrosis, 68 with cirrhosis, and 67 uninfected volunteers. We analyzed plasma levels of soluble CD14 (sCD14), intestinal fatty acid binding protein, and interleukin-6 by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by the limulus amebocyte lysate assay, at presentation and after antiviral treatment.\nCompared with uninfected individuals, HCV- and HBV-infected individuals had higher plasma levels of LPS, intestinal fatty acid binding protein (indicating enterocyte death), sCD14 (produced upon LPS activation of monocytes), and interleukin-6. Portal hypertension, indicated by low platelet counts, was associated with enterocyte death (P=.045 at presentation, P<.0001 after therapy). Levels of sCD14 correlated with markers of hepatic inflammation (P=.02 for aspartate aminotransferase, P=.002 for ferritin) and fibrosis (P<.0001 for γ-glutamyl transpeptidase, P=.01 for alkaline phosphatase, P<.0001 for α-fetoprotein). Compared to subjects with minimal fibrosis, subjects with severe fibrosis at presentation had higher plasma levels of sCD14 (P=.01) and more hepatic CD14+ cells (P=.0002); each increased risk for disease progression (P=.0009 and P=.005, respectively).\nQuestion: Does host response to translocated microbial products predict outcomes of patients with HBV or HCV infection?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Palmitoleic acid was previously shown to improve glucose homeostasis by reducing hepatic glucose production and by enhancing insulin-stimulated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Herein we tested the hypothesis that palmitoleic acid positively modulates glucose uptake and metabolism in adipocytes.\nFor this, both differentiated 3 T3-L1 cells treated with either palmitoleic acid (16:1n7, 200 μM) or palmitic acid (16:0, 200 μM) for 24 h and primary adipocytes from mice treated with 16:1n7 (300 mg/kg/day) or oleic acid (18:1n9, 300 mg/kg/day) by gavage for 10 days were evaluated for glucose uptake, oxidation, conversion to lactate and incorporation into fatty acids and glycerol components of TAG along with the activity and expression of lipogenic enzymes.\nTreatment of adipocytes with palmitoleic, but not oleic (in vivo) or palmitic (in vitro) acids, increased basal and insulin-stimulated glucose uptake and GLUT4 mRNA levels and protein content. Along with uptake, palmitoleic acid enhanced glucose oxidation (aerobic glycolysis), conversion to lactate (anaerobic glycolysis) and incorporation into glycerol-TAG, but reduced de novo fatty acid synthesis from glucose and acetate and the activity of lipogenic enzymes glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase and ATP-citrate lyase. Importantly, palmitoleic acid induction of adipocyte glucose uptake and metabolism were associated with AMPK activation as evidenced by the increased protein content of phospho(p)Thr172AMPKα, but no changes in pSer473Akt and pThr308Akt. Importantly, such increase in GLUT4 content induced by 16:1n7, was prevented by pharmacological inhibition of AMPK with compound C.\nQuestion: Does palmitoleic acid ( n-7 ) increase white adipocytes GLUT4 content and glucose uptake in association with AMPK activation?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: The endocannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) is encoded by the CNR1 gene and has been recently recognized to play an important role in the regulation of satiety and feeding behaviour with a huge potential of modulating metabolic response and feeding control. The aim of  the study was to investigate the potential of three selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the CNR1 locus on native dietary composition in the Central-European Caucasian population.\nA total of 258 unrelated individuals originating from the Central-European  Caucasian population were enrolled into the study and rs1049353, rs12720071, and rs806368 polymorphisms in CNR1 locus were examined in these individuals using PCR-based methodology. Body composition was assessed using a bioimpedance method, various anthropometric parameters were investigated  (waist and hip circumference, skin folds), and native dietary composition was analysed using 7-day food records as well as a food frequency questionnaire.\nAllelic variations and common haplotypes in the CNR1 gene were associated with the daily intake of proteins,  fluids, and fibre, regardless of the physical activity of the individuals. The common haplotype in the CNR1 gene was associated with self-reported smoking (number of cigarettes per day, smoking years).\nQuestion: Does variability in CNR1 locus influence protein intake and smoking status in the Central-European population?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: We conducted a prospective study of 103 consecutive patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent a curative lobectomy to test whether circulating tumor cells detected in the peripheral blood by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction of carcinoembryonic antigen messenger RNA is a prognostic indicator independent of tumor stage in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.\nWe assayed for carcinoembryonic antigen messenger RNA by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction in peripheral blood taken at the time of diagnosis before an operation and again 2 to 3 weeks after an operation from patients with non-small cell lung cancer who underwent a curative lobectomy between March 1996 and April 1998. We analyzed the prognostic value of carcinoembryonic antigen messenger RNA expression in the patients with non-small cell lung cancer in a univariate and multivariate manner.\nPatients with carcinoembryonic antigen messenger RNA in the preoperative blood samples had a poor survival when compared with those without carcinoembryonic antigen messenger RNA. Of these patients, the worst survival was seen in those with carcinoembryonic antigen messenger RNA in the postoperative blood samples. The multivariate stepwise analysis selected the preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen messenger RNA expression (P =.0004; relative risk, 0.21) and the pathologic stage of disease (P =.0002; relative risk, 1.43) as the independent prognostic factors for survival.\nQuestion: Is preoperative evidence of circulating tumor cells by means of reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction for carcinoembryonic antigen messenger RNA an independent predictor of survival in non-small cell lung cancer : a prospective study?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Little is known regarding the long-term performance of coronary sinus (CS) leads, which have an effect on the longevity of cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) systems.\nThis study included 109 patients (79 men) whose mean age was 68 +/- 9 years, New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class 3.2 +/- 0.5, and left ventricular ejection fraction 25.6 +/- 6.6%, and who underwent CRT (n = 45) or CRT-D (n = 64) systems implants for management of idiopathic (53%), ischemic (40%), or miscellaneous (7%) dilated cardiomyopathy. Unipolar (n = 57) or bipolar (n = 52) leads were placed into the CS venous system.\nAt implant, no significant difference was observed between unipolar and bipolar leads with respect to mean sensing performance (14 +/- 6 mV vs 14 +/- 8 mV, P = 0.97), pacing impedance (875 +/- 234 ohms vs 943 +/- 331 ohms, P = 0.24), and stimulation energy threshold (2 +/- 3.2 muJ vs 1.13 +/- 1.5 muJ, P = 0.08). At a median follow-up of 33 months, a significant decrease in stimulation impedance and increase in stimulation energy threshold was observed with unipolar (689 +/- 122 vs 875 +/- 234 ohms, P < 0.01, and 8.34 +/- 10.4 muJ vs 2 +/- 3.2 muJ, P < 0.001, respectively) as well as with bipolar (735 +/- 268 ohms vs 943 +/- 331 ohms, P < 0.01, and 4.81 +/- 9.92 vs 1.13 +/- 1.5 muJ, P = 0.02, respectively) leads. No significant difference in sensing performance was observed with either type of lead (10 +/- 5 mV vs 14 +/- 6 mV and 10 +/- 6 mV vs 14 +/- 8 mV, respectively). At long-term follow-up, no significant difference among any sensing or stimulation parameter was observed between unipolar and bipolar leads.\nQuestion: Does long-term performance of coronary sinus lead used for cardiac resynchronization therapy?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Preeclampsia (PE) is a multifactorial pregnancy complication. Maternal underlying condition and adverse factors both influence the pathogenesis of PE. Abnormal lipid metabolism as a maternal underlying disease may participate in the occurrence and development of PE. This study aimed to observe the effects of adverse factors on PE-like symptoms of pregnant mice with genetic abnormal lipid metabolism.\nApolipoprotein C-III (ApoC3) transgenic mice with abnormal lipid metabolism were subcutaneously injected with L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) or normal saline (NS) daily starting at Day 7 or 16 of pregnancy (ApoC3+L-NA and ApoC3+NS groups), and wild-type (WT) mice served as a control (WT+L-NA and WT+NS groups). All mice were subdivided into early and late subgroups by injection time. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and urinary protein were measured. Pregnancy outcomes, including fetal weight, placental weight, live birth rate, and fetal absorption rate, were analyzed. Pathologic changes in the placenta were observed by hematoxylin-eosin staining. One-way analysis of variance, t-test, and χ(2) test were used for statistical analysis.\nMAP significantly increased for ApoC3+NS groups compared with WT+NS groups (P < 0.05), without significant difference in urine protein. Following L-NAME injection, MAP and urinary protein significantly increased for ApoC3+L-NA and WT+L-NA compared with the corresponding NS groups (P < 0.05), and the increase for ApoC3+L-NA was more obvious. Urinary protein levels in early ApoC3+L-NA and WT+L-NA significantly increased compared with the corresponding late groups (P < 0.05). Fetal absorption rate significantly increased and fetal and placental weights significantly decreased in early ApoC3+L-NA and WT+L-NA compared with the corresponding NS groups (P < 0.05), without significant difference in late ApoC3+L-NA and WT+L-NA groups. Fetal weight in early ApoC3+L-NA was significantly lower than in early WT+L-NA group (P < 0.05). Morphologic examination of placentas from early ApoC3+L-NA and WT+L-NA groups showed varying degrees of fibrinoid necrosis.\nQuestion: Do adverse factors increase preeclampsia-like changes in pregnant mice with abnormal lipid metabolism?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To determine if docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid (ARA) supplementation influences growth or visual acuity of formula-fed premature infants.\nDouble-blind, multi-center study of 194 premature infants given preterm formula with no DHA or ARA (control), 0.15% energy DHA, or 0.14% DHA + 0.27% ARA from single-cell triglycerides for at least 28 days and then fed term formula (no DHA or ARA) to 57 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA), with 90 breast-fed term infants as reference.\nInfants fed DHA+ARA formula gained weight significantly faster (post-hoc analysis) during preterm formula feeding than control infants (34.7 vs. 30.7 g/d) and had weights and weight:length ratios not different from term breast-fed infants at 48 and 57 weeks PMA. Infants fed control or DHA formula had lower body weights than term infants. Red blood cell phosphatidylethanolamine ARA was significantly correlated to weight gain during preterm formula feeding and to weight and length at 40, 48, and 57 weeks PMA (r = 0.19 to 0.24, P =.004-.02). Providing DHA or DHA+ARA during the preterm period had no effect on subsequent visual acuity or incidence of adverse events.\nQuestion: Do docosahexaenoic acid and arachidonic acid enhance growth with no adverse effects in preterm infants fed formula?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Conditional survival estimates provide useful prognostic information for cancer survivors. The objective of this study was to determine conditional survival estimates for melanoma patients with substages of stage III disease.\nA retrospective analysis of 760 patients who underwent lymphadenectomy for node-positive melanoma was conducted, and patients were stratified into substages: IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC. The 5-year conditional disease-free survival (DFS) and disease-specific survival (DSS) were calculated following lymphadenectomy using the methods of Kaplan and Meier and were reassessed for survivors on an annual basis. Multivariate Cox regression models were used to calculate adjusted conditional DFS and DSS accounting for age, gender, tumor histology, and extracapsular extension.\nFor patients with IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC disease, 5-year conditional DSS from treatment to year 5 improved from 78% to 90%, 54% to 79%, and 39% to 78%, respectively. For 5-year conditional DFS over the same period, the estimates increased from 65% to 79%, 37% to 81%, and 26% to 92%, respectively. Male patients experienced decreased 5-year conditional DSS and DFS across all substages, with the most pronounced effect on DSS in stage IIIC. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that survival differences among stage IIIC patients based on histologic subtype and extracapsular extension decreased over time.\nQuestion: Does conditional survival estimate improve over 5 years for melanoma survivors with node-positive disease?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Airway smooth muscle (ASM) hyperplasia is a feature of asthma, and increases with disease severity. We hypothesized that this results from migration of ASM or progenitors in response to chemokines derived from ASM or mast cells within the ASM bundle.\nTo examine expression of the chemokine receptor, CC chemokine receptor (CCR) 7, in vivo by ASM in patients with asthma and healthy control subjects, and by primary cultures of ASM and fibroblasts; to define expression of its ligands, CC chemokine ligand (CCL) 19 and CCL21, in bronchial biopsies, and primary cultures of ASM and mast cells; and to investigate CCR7's role in ASM migration and repair.\nASM was isolated from bronchoscopy and resection tissue. Receptor and chemokine expression was examined by immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence, flow cytometry, ELISA, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. CCR7 function was examined by intracellular calcium measurements, chemotaxis, wound healing assays, and measurement of cell proliferation.\nASM, myofibroblasts, and fibroblasts expressed CCR7. CCL19, but not CCL21, was highly expressed in bronchial biopsies by mast cells and vessels in asthma of all severities, ASM in severe disease, and ex vivo ASM and mast cells. ASM CCR7 activation by CCL19-mediated intracellular calcium elevation and concentration-dependent migration, but not proliferation. Importantly, mast cell and ASM-derived CCL19 mediated ASM migration and repair.\nQuestion: Do airway smooth muscle and mast cell-derived CC chemokine ligand 19 mediate airway smooth muscle migration in asthma?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To investigate, in a large cohort of 2494 individuals with diabetes mellitus, whether functional single nucleotide polymorphisms in the promoter region of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and lymphotoxin-alpha (LTA) genes are associated with type of diabetes or presence of diabetic retinopathy.\nA total of 334 type 1 diabetes and 999 type 2 diabetes participants with sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy, and 260 type 1 diabetes and 901 type 2 diabetes participants with no diabetic retinopathy or minimal non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, were genotyped for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs1800629 and rs361525).\nThe A allele of rs1800629 was associated with type 1 diabetes (p < 0.001; odds ratio = 0.62). After adjustment for age, sex, diabetes duration, HbA1c, hypertension and nephropathy, no significant association was found between rs1800629 or rs361525 and sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy.\nQuestion: Is promoter polymorphism at the tumour necrosis factor/lymphotoxin-alpha locus associated with type of diabetes but not with susceptibility to sight-threatening diabetic retinopathy?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Symptomatic Primary Humoral Immunodeficiency Diseases (PHID) constitute a highly heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by a shared hypogammaglobulinemia, resulting in increased risk of recurrent or severe infections. Associations have been described with a variety of immunological abnormalities involving B and T-cell differentiation, T-cell activation and innate immunity. However, PHID discrimination remains based on B-lymphocyte abnormalities and other components of the immune system have not been sufficiently taken into account. We carried out unsupervised and supervised methods for classification in a cohort of 81 symptomatic PHID patients to evaluate the relative importance of 23 immunological parameters and to select relevant markers that may be useful for diagnosis and prognosis.\nWe identified five groups of patients, among which the percentage of PHID complications varied substantially. Combining the set of markers involved in PHID supported the existence of two distinct mechanisms associated with complications. Switched memory B-cell attrition and CD8+ HLA-DR + activated T-cell increase were the prominent abnormalities observed in PHID complications. Furthermore, in a subgroup of 57 patients with common variable immunodeficiency, the classification that added CD8+ HLA-DR + to the consensual EUROclass classification was better than the EUROclass model in predicting complications.\nQuestion: Does t-cell activation discriminate subclasses of symptomatic primary humoral immunodeficiency diseases in adults?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) can improve disturbances of indigenous microflora as well as inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease. We examined the anticolitic effect of Lactobacillus suntoryeus HY7801, which inhibited toll-like receptor (TLR)-4-linked NF-kappaB activation in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells, in 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS)-induced colitic mice.\nWe measured the ability of commercial and intestinal LAB to inhibit lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated, TLR-4-linked NF-kappaB activation in HEK cells, as well as to inhibit colitis outcomes in TNBS-induced colitic mice. We also measured levels of the inflammatory markers, interleukin (IL)-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and IL-6, and their transcription factor, NF-kappaB, in intestinal mucosa by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting.\nQuestion: Does lactobacillus suntoryeus inhibit pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and TLR-4-linked NF-kappaB activation in experimental colitis?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To determine whether the association of seminal vesicle cyst (SVC) and renal anomaly in young children correlates with previously reported cases of SVCs in adolescent and adult patients, as congenital SVCs, although rare, are frequently described in association with ipsilateral renal agenesis, mainly in adolescent and adult patients, whereas reports on SVCs in younger children are sparse.\nWe report on nine infants (median age 4 months) with congenital SVCs, all of them associated with ipsilateral dysplastic kidneys. All patients had ultrasonography of the renal system and voiding cysto-urethrography. Magnetic resonance imaging was used in two patients.\nThe SVCs were found incidentally during ultrasonography for the renal anomaly. Three patients had dysplastic and six had multicystic dysplastic kidneys. In previous reported adult cases of SVCs the most common associated renal anomaly was agenesis of the ipsilateral kidney (25 of 44 cases), whereas only one case of dysplastic kidney was reported.\nQuestion: Is dysplastic kidney and not renal agenesis the commonly associated anomaly in infants with seminal vesicle cyst?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: The SELH/Bc mouse inbred strain, with a high frequency of nonsyndromic, genetically-multifactorial exencephaly, is a model for human cranial neural tube defects (NTDs). Maternal diet affects risk of human NTDs.\nExencephaly frequencies in SELH/Bc embryos were compared in 8 studies in which dams were fed alternative commercial Purina diets (5015 and 5001) or semisynthetic diets, and in several studies in which maternal diet was supplemented with a specific nutrient, either in drinking water or food before and during pregnancy, or by intraperitoneal injection on E7 and/or E8.\nThe exencephaly frequency in SELH/Bc embryos was 2- to 8-fold higher when the dams were fed Purina 5015 (averaging 23% exencephaly) or a semisynthetic diet modeled on Purina 5015 (averaging 28%) or NIH-31 standard diet (23%), compared with Purina 5001 (averaging 7%). The exencephaly frequency remained high (41%) on a semisynthetic diet modeled on Purina 5001. The exencephaly frequency was not reduced significantly by maternal supplementation with folic acid, nor with each of zinc, methionine, niacin, brewers' yeast, riboflavin, vitamin B12, or inositol. Nor was it reduced by maternal diets with supplemental methyl donors and cofactors or with reduced fat.\nQuestion: Does maternal diet alter exencephaly frequency in SELH/Bc strain mouse embryos?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: The effects of a computer-assisted instruction (CAI) tutorial program on learning clinical reasoning skills were compared in undergraduate dietetics students.\nA drill-and-practice program to control for time on task, and tutorial program, and a simulation program, as the test vehicle, were developed. The tutorial and simulation programs presented data on a patient with cardiovascular disease.\nSubjects were tested in 30 undergraduate dietetics programs.\nParticipants were 413 undergraduate diet therapy students enrolled in a coordinated program in dietetics (CPD) or a didactic program in dietetics (DPD).\nAfter completion of lectures on cardiovascular disease, subjects were given the drill-and-practice program plus a simulation test (group 1), the tutorial plus a simulation test (group 2), or the simulation test only (group 3).\nScores on the simulation test were compared. Variables included type of CAI, dietetics program, year in school, computer experience, and experience using a medical chart. Mastery of objectives related to lower- and higher-level clinical reasoning skills introduced in the tutorial program was computed.\nOne-way analysis of variance and Student-Newman Keuls tests were conducted to determine any differences among the three groups. Reliability was determined using the Kuder-Richardson Formula 20.\nThe reliability coefficient of the stimulation test was 0.93. Group 2 higher on the simulation test than group 1 or group 3. As a group, the CPD students scored higher than the DPD students. When CPD and DPD students were divided into the three experimental groups, there was no significant difference between the CPD and DPD student simulation scores. Group 2 mastered all objectives for lower-level reasoning skills and the higher-level decision-making objective better than groups 1 and 3.\nQuestion: Does computer-assisted instruction improve clinical reasoning skills of dietetics students?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Pain during chest tube removal can be moderately to severely intense and distressful to patients. Little evidence-based research has guided clinicians in attempts to alleviate such pain.\nTo test pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions to alleviate pain during chest tube removal in cardiac surgery patients.\nFour interventions were tested in 74 patients in a randomized, double-blind study: (1) 4 mg intravenous morphine and procedural information; (2) 30 mg intravenous ketorolac and procedural information; (3) 4 mg intravenous morphine plus procedural and sensory information; and (4) 30 mg intravenous ketorolac plus procedural and sensory information. Analgesics were administered to correspond to peak effect, and scripted information was provided. Pain intensity and pain distress were measured before analgesic administration, immediately after chest tube removal, and 20 minutes later Pain quality was measured immediately after chest tube removal. Level of sedation was measured before and 20 minutes after chest tube removal. Repeated-measures analyses of variance were used to test differences among groups over time.\nPain intensity, pain distress, and sedation levels did not differ significantly among groups. However, procedural pain intensity (mean 3.26, SD 3.00) and pain distress (mean 2.98, SD 3.18) scores for all were low. Patients remained alert, regardless of which analgesic was administered.\nQuestion: Do appropriately timed analgesics control pain due to chest tube removal?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Copper toxicosis (CT) in Bedlington terriers is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by massive lysosomal copper accumulation in livers of affected dogs, and a defect in the biliary excretion of this metal. We propose that MURR1, the gene defective in canine CT, has a role in the regulation of copper excretion into bile during copper overload.\nPolyclonal antibodies raised against full-length recombinant human MURR1 were used for immunoblot analysis and indirect immunofluorescence studies.\nUsing Western blot analysis, these antibodies abundantly detected MURR1 as a 23 kDa protein in liver extracts of mice and dogs, but MURR1 was undetectable in the livers of affected Bedlington terriers. MURR1 was also detected in different tissues and cell lines; in cell lines the protein was found both in cytosol and membrane preparations. Consistent with this observation, indirect immunofluorescence staining revealed that in some cells MURR1 was associated with a vesicular compartment diffusely localized throughout the cell.\nQuestion: Is the ubiquitously expressed MURR1 protein absent in canine copper toxicosis?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: To investigate whether nucleosome assembly protein 1-like 1 (Nap1l1) regulates the proliferation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) and the potential mechanisms.\nNap1l1-knockdown-iPSC and Nap1l1-overexpression-iPSC were constructed by transfection of lentiviral particles. The proliferation of iPSC was detected by MTT analysis, and cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry.\nNap1l1 overexpression promoted iPSC proliferation and induced G2/M transition compared to their control iPSC while Nap1l1-knockdown-iPSC dramatically displayed the reduced proliferation and accumulated G2/M phase cells. Further analysis showed that Nap1l1 overexpression in iPSC increased the expression of cyclin B1, downregulated the expression of p21 and p27, while knockdown of Nap1l1 showed the opposite effects. In addition, overexpression of Nap1l1 promoted the phosphorylation of AKT and ERK in iPSC, while knockdown of Nap1l1 inhibited the effects. However, these effects displayed in Nap1l1-overexpression-iPSC were greatly suppressed by the inhibition of AKT or ERK signaling.\nQuestion: Does nucleosome Assembly Protein 1-Like 1 ( Nap1l1 ) regulate the Proliferation of Murine Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: We previously demonstrated that the intratumoral injection of biodegradable polylactic acid microspheres that were loaded with interleukin (IL)-12 can induce a systemic antitumor immunity. We sought to investigate the clinical potential as neoadjuvant therapy.\nMice were inoculated with 5 x 10(7) Line-1 cells subcutaneously. Six days later, a single intratumoral injection of IL-12- or BSA-loaded microspheres were given; 14 days later, autopsy was performed to document metastases. Mice were inoculated with 5 x 10(7) Line-1 cells and 10 days later either treated with IL-12- or BSA-loaded microspheres or resected. Treated tumors were resected 6 days after treatment. Mice were observed 45 days for local recurrence before autopsy.\nIntratumoral injection of IL-12 microspheres resulted in significant suppression of tumor growth compared with controls (599 +/- 255 mm(3) vs 1591 +/- 372 mm(3); P =.001) and pulmonary metastases (0.4 vs 3.8 nodules per mouse; P =.003). Given before the operation, IL-12-loaded microspheres both decreased the local recurrence rate (100% to 40%) and pulmonary metastases (5.2 vs 0.6 nodules per mouse; P =.06). Earlier resection did not improve local recurrence or distant metastases.\nQuestion: Does neoadjuvant therapy with interleukin-12-loaded polylactic acid microspheres reduce local recurrence and distant metastases?\nAnswer:", "Abstract: Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is associated with type II cryoglobulinemia.

Roddick needed just 63 minutes to defeat the 18-year-old Japanese who won his first ATP title on Sunday and was on an eight-match winning run. But American number one Roddick imposed his quality from the start by taking a commanding 3-0 lead and breaking Nishikori's serve before the youngster won a game. Roddick, who has won twice in San Jose, repeated the break later in a feisty opening set which came to a head in the seventh game. Roddick barked at the young player as they exchanged shots at the net. Nishikori held his cool, did not respond, and just walked away. \"I didn't understand a word he said,\" Nishikori said. But when pressed he acknowledged that he did in fact understand what Roddick had shouted at him but just did not want to repeat it before the press. But Roddick had no trouble repeating what he had said. \"I told him to stick me with it the next time. I just let him know that he needs to finish it. I had no problem with it. But it was a monologue.\" Roddick duly rounded off the set in the next game and broke Nishikori's service in the fourth game of the second only for his youthful opponent to break straight.", "Summarize the following article: (LiveWire) -- Voluble Gary Vaynerchuk, 31, the host of \"Wine Library TV,\" an online video show, has been known to lick rocks, suck leather and eat dirt while on camera, all to illustrate the unique properties of wine. \"Wine Library TV\" host Gary Vaynerchuk discusses four spooky wine varieties for Halloween show. Of a \"wild and gamey\" red from Rioja, Spain, Vaynerchuk says, \"Hit a deer on the road. Throw a bunch of cherries on it. Take out your knife, cut the deer. Bite it. That's the flavor profile.\" That kind of attitude appeals to people who are mystified by the arcane lexicon of traditional wine journals or turned off by what they perceive as elitist barriers.

About 40,000 Internet viewers -- many of them 20-somethings -- have a daily appointment with \"Wine Library TV.\" The low-budget video blog is produced five days a week from a nondescript office in the three-level wine retail operation that Vaynerchuk's family owns in Springfield, New Jersey. Vaynerchuk has a discerning nose and palate, and he doesn't dumb down his subject.

Abu Dujana is suspected of plotting attacks on the Australian Embassy and J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta. Abu Dujana is the alleged leader of the military wing of Jemaah Islamiyah, a group that is thought to be linked to al Qaeda. It aims to create a Muslim \"superstate\" across much of Southeast Asia. Dujana, a slight, wiry man, is accused of direct involvement in the Bali nightclub bombings of 2002 that killed more than 200, mostly Western, tourists. He is also suspected of plotting subsequent attacks on the Australian Embassy and J.W. Marriott hotel, both in the Indonesian capital, Jakarta. Furthermore, authorities say Dujana is behind the violence in Poso, on Indonesia's eastern Sulawesi island. Fighting between Muslims and Christians periodically breaks out in the region and sometimes turns deadly. Police have accused Jemaah Islamiyah of sending armed militants to Poso. The court found Dujana guilty Monday of illegally possessing firearms and explosives, and of harboring suspected terrorists. His lawyers said they may appeal the sentence. After his arrest last June following a four-year hunt, Dujana admitted to CNN that he was Jemaah Islamiyah's military chief. But he said that happened only after the attacks on Western targets.

Jeffs, the leader and so-called prophet of the 10,000-member Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, is now awaiting sentencing after being convicted on two counts of being an accomplice to rape. The documents, released by Fifth District Judge James Shumate at the request of the media, also indicate that Jeffs confessed to \"immorality\" with a \"sister\" and a daughter more than 30 years ago.

Hubbard's recommendation is advisory and will not necessarily prevent Atkins' release. The court -- not the department or the state Board of Parole Hearings -- has the final say on whether Atkins should be released, Thornton said. \"They're the only ones legally who can recall the sentence,\" she added.

Tomas Medina Caracas, known popularly as \"El Negro Acacio,\" was a member of the high command of the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia and, according to Colombian and U.S. officials, helped manage the group's extensive cocaine trafficking network. He had been in the cross-hairs of the U.S. Justice Department since 2002. He was charged with conspiracy to import cocaine into the United States and manufacturing and distributing cocaine within Colombia to fund the FARC's 42-year insurgency against the government. U.S. officials alleged Medina Caracas managed the rebel group's sales of cocaine to international drug traffickers, who in turn smuggled it into the United States. He was also indicted in the United States along with two other FARC commanders in November 2002 on charges of conspiring to kidnap two U.S. oil workers from neighboring Venezuela in 1997 and holding one of them for nine months until a $1 million ransom was paid.

Janet Jenkins with Isabella, the daughter she helped raise with former partner Lisa Miller. Virginia's Supreme Court ruled that Janet Jenkins and Lisa Miller's civil union in 2000 gave Vermont, and its law on same-sex unions, jurisdiction over their subsequent custody and visitation disputes. Miller moved to Virginia with the child in 2003, and a Vermont court granted Jenkins visitation rights. But Miller took the case to a Virginia court, which ruled that Jenkins had no such rights there. The case was considered by legal experts to be the first conflict between two state courts over a major legal question arising from same-sex unions. Jenkins' attorney, Joseph Price of the Washington law firm Arent Fox, said Friday's ruling \"just affirms the old principle that when these kinds of custody and visitation disputes begin in one state, that's where they should remain.\" \"You can't shop them around to another state,\" Price said. \"Virginia really had no choice but to enforce judgments and judicial orders from Vermont.\" Vermont is one of the few states that allow same-sex partners to enter into a civil union.

Waterboarding threatened to derail the approval of President Bush's nominee to lead the Justice Department. President Bush nominated Mukasey to replace longtime ally Alberto Gonzales, who resigned in September. The nomination had been considered at risk after a number of Democratic senators opposed Mukasey because of questions that arose from his views on the terror interrogation technique known as waterboarding and the president's power to order electronic surveillance. Mukasey, a former federal judge in New York, told senators he considers waterboarding \"repugnant,\" but he could not categorically say whether the technique amounts to torture, which U.S. and international law bans. Waterboarding is a technique that involves restraining a suspect and pouring water on him to produce the sensation of drowning. Mukasey's confirmation was all but assured last week when two key Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee -- Sens. Dianne Feinstein of California and Chuck Schumer of New York -- said they would vote in favor of Mukasey despite the controversy. \"The Department of Justice, once the crown jewel among government institutions, is adrift and rudderless,\" Schumer said Tuesday -- the same day the committee voted 11-8 to send Mukasey's nomination to the Senate floor. \"It desperately needs a strong and independent leader at the helm to set it back on course and I believe Judge Mukasey is that person.\" Schumer said that in a meeting Friday the.", "Summarize the following article: GEROLSTEIN, Germany -- Mineral water company Gerolsteiner have decided to drop their sponsorship of the German ProTour cycling team, which expires at the end of the 2008 season.

So, how did the trend for pointed-toe shoes start? Manolo who? Long before they ever made an appearance on the TV show \"Sex and the City,\" pointed shoes were favored by Polish nobles, who introduced the fashion to England on a diplomatic visit in the 1300s. The shoes, dubbed \"crackowes\" or \"poulaines\" -- after Kraków, Poland -- were so long that a chain running from the toe to the knee was often required to keep them from dragging. In 1363 the English attempted to rein in the look by law, assigning shoe spans to social classes. Commoners could sport footwear with toes of up to six inches, while those in the royal ranks were allowed a full two feet in length. Who invented the sports bra? In 1977 University of Vermont student Lisa Lindahl was running 30 miles a week -- and her bra wasn't holding up. With the help of two classmates, Lindahl sewed together two jock straps and -- presto! -- the sports bra was born.

The UK political elite boycotted events. Demonstrators lined the Mall. The UK foreign secretary pulled out of a meeting with his Saudi counterpart to be with his new adopted son. And just days before he arrived, the Saudi King accused British officials of ignoring information that could have averted the terror attacks in London on July 2005. Whether the politics of the event were a success is open to debate. But this was just part of the story. The Saudis were also in town to cement a strong trading and business relationship that has developed between the two Kingdoms over the last 20 years.

Workers remove fuel rods on the reactor floor at North Korea's Yongbyon nuclear facility this year. In fact, North Korea's confessions of many of its nuclear sins -- and its shutdown of its nuclear reactor at Yongbyon -- are the closest the international community has come to curbing North Korea's nuclear program. As a result of Pyongyang's handover of the 60-page declaration document -- and Friday's expected destruction of the cooling tower at Yongbyon -- President Bush ordered some sanctions against North Korea lifted and instructed the State Department to remove the reclusive communist nation from U.S. lists of enemies and nations that support terrorism. But as important as what the document says is what it doesn't say. There is no mention of how many weapons North Korea has or where they are hidden. Nor did North Korea admit to a suspected uranium enrichment program or what nuclear secrets it may have shared with Syria. Both issues are reduced in the declaration to \"concerns\" Pyongyang promises to address down the road. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice have pledged a robust verification process to double-check North Korea's claims. And North Korea has promised to allow U.S. inspectors access to the Yongbyon facility and to interview its nuclear experts.

Greeted by about 50 well-wishers, Pojamarn arrived at court accompanied by her three children. She faces charges stemming from a Bangkok land deal and a stock concealment plan that could put her in jail for up to eight years, according to the Thai News Agency. The court released her on 5 million baht (about $168,000) bail and ordered her not to leave the country. On Monday, Thaksin's attorney Noppadon Pattama said the former prime minister would return from exile in mid-April to answer to the same charges his wife faces. He was deposed by a military junta in Sept. 2006 and fled to London. He plans to return after Thailand's new government is in place.

One of the babies died. Officials at Christus Spohn Hospital South say corrective action was taken after the discovery of the overdoses. The infant was one of 17 who may have received a more concentrated form of heparin than was prescribed, Christus Spohn Hospital South said in a statement. Heparin is an anticoagulant often used to clean the IVs of patients and prevent blood clots from forming in the lines. It came into the public spotlight last year when newborn twins of actor Dennis Quaid nearly died after receiving an overdose at a Los Angeles hospital. Nursing staff at the Corpus Christi hospital discovered the problem Sunday -- two days after the medication is believed to have been first administered, according to Bruce Holstien, president and CEO of Christus Spohn Health System. The hospital said it took corrective measures after the discovery. A preliminary investigation concluded that \"the medication error occurred during the mixing process within the hospital pharmacy,\" Holstein said in a statement. The baby who died \"was seriously ill, and we do not know at this time what role, if any, the higher than expected concentration of heparin played in this baby's death,\" Dr. Richard Davis, chief medical officer for the health system, said Tuesday. \"Our deepest sympathy goes out to this family,\" he said. Twelve of the 16 other babies remain in stable condition in the.", "Summarize the following article: SAN DIEGO, California (CNN) -- Conditions that created what California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger dubbed \"the perfect storm for fire\" eased Wednesday, helping firefighters gain ground against devastating Southern California wildfires. A plane drops fire retardant on the fourth day of a wildfire pushed by winds through Pauma Valley, California. Winds that gusted as much as 101 mph on Sunday dropped to about 30 mph Wednesday evening. Meanwhile, the dry Santa Ana winds that have fanned the flames, changed direction and began blowing inland from the Pacific Ocean, increasing the humidity and easing the burden on almost 8,900 firefighters in the area. But the destruction was taking its toll on the men and women on the front lines of the fires. \"It hurts us to have those homes lost. It hurts us to have those injuries. And it is frustrating for us to watch our community be devastated by this,\" said firefighter Andy Menshek. As conditions improved, officials allowed people to return to communities that had been off-limits because of intense flames and dense smoke. \"It was home,\" said Mark Davis, whose two-story Rancho Bernardo house burned to the ground. \"It was us. We had been there 28 years, and it had a lot of our flavor.\" The change in the weather also meant that firefighting aircraft -- grounded for most of the week by the winds -- could finally fly. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection Capt. Scott McLean called the droning sound of aircraft the \"sound of joy.\" \"Their drops are hitting their mark.", "Summarize the following article: HARYANA, India (CNN) -- In a nation of more than a billion people and millions of unresolved court cases, how do you take care of the backlog? Long distances over questionable roads stop many Indians from making it into courtrooms. Solution: You take the courts to the people. A bell rings. A bailiff yells out the name of the accused. It's another day in the mobile courtroom of Judge Sandeep Singh. His courtroom is a desk plopped down in the middle of a dusty schoolyard in the northern Indian village of Haryana. \"It works like any other regular court,\" Singh said. \"The only difference is that instead of people going to the court, the court comes to the village.\" The mobile court is bused into rural areas to hear both criminal and civil complaints as part of an effort to dig the nation's court system out from under an enormous backlog of cases. With an estimated 300 million unresolved cases languishing in Indian courts, one consultant believes, it could take more than 300 years to clear the docket at the current pace. There's one main reason for the backlog: inconvenience. People often have to travel long distances over questionable roads, using slow modes of transportation. \"The witnesses -- definitely, they don't show up -- and even the parties -- they don't show up -- and they send their advocate,\" Singh said. \"But here, people are closer by, so definitely it makes a difference.\" With distance no longer a problem, more villagers and their attorneys are coming.", "Summarize the following article: WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Democratic presidential front-runner Sen. Barack Obama is in excellent health, according to a statement from his doctor, released by the campaign. Besides being an \"intermittent smoker,\" Sen. Barack Obama is in excellent health, his doctor says. Obama, 46, last saw Dr. David Scheiner in January 2007, shortly before he declared he was running for president. Scheiner, who has been Obama's primary doctor since 1987, observed that the Illinois senator's diet, weight, blood pressure and cholesterol were all healthy. \"In short, his examination showed him to be in excellent health,\" Scheiner said. Obama \"exercised regularly, often jogging three miles. His diet was balanced with good intake of roughage and fluids. ... On physical examination, his blood pressure was 90/60 and pulse 60/minute,\" Scheiner wrote. The Illinois senator has been an \"intermittent\" cigarette smoker who has \"quit on several occasions and is currently using Nicorette gum with success.\" Sen. John McCain, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, released his health records last week. McCain's doctors also described him as being in \"excellent health,\" despite a history of skin cancer, and said there appears to be no physical reason why the 71-year-old candidate could not carry out the duties of the office. Obama released a one-page statement from his primary care physician. He did not release any medical records or make his doctors available to the media. By contrast, McCain made more than 1,000 pages of medical documents available to journalists, including CNN's chief medical correspondent, Dr. Sanjay Gupta.

Neanderthal man apparently sounded like a frog croaking or a human burping when talking. Robert McCarthy of Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton reconstructed Neanderthal vocal tracts to simulate their voice with a computer synthesizer. The result is a single syllable that sounds strange and unremarkable: part croaking frog, part burping human. But McCarthy says that's because Neanderthals lacked the \"quantal vowels\" modern humans use. \"They would have spoken a bit differently,\" McCarthy said at the annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthropologists in Ohio this month. \"They wouldn't have been able to produce these quantal vowels that form the basis of spoken language.\" New Scientist magazine discussed McCarthy's findings and linked to his vocal simulation on its Web site. Listen to Neanderthal man speak . McCarthy used 50,000-year-old fossils from France to make his reconstruction, New Scientist said. He plans to simulate an entire Neanderthal sentence, the magazine reported. To reconstruct the vocal tracts, McCarthy teamed with linguist Phil Lieberman, who worked in the 1970s to deduce the dimensions of a Neanderthal larynx based on its skull.

Officers lead Al Sharpton, center, through Jena, Louisiana, during Thursday's protest. They swarmed over the grounds of Jena High School, where nooses were hung from a tree in early August 2006, about three months before six black teens known as the \"Jena 6\" were accused of beating a white classmate. While the tension was palpable, news broke Thursday afternoon that the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeal ordered a hearing within 72 hours to determine if the only one of the six still behind bars can be released. The order has \"got to be good,\" Mychal Bell's attorney, Bob Noel, told CNN. \"It means we have a day in court.

Gloria Taylor outside London's Central Criminal Court with Damilola's older brother Tunde in 2006. Gloria Taylor, 57, collapsed while walking with her husband Richard in south-east London Tuesday, the agency reported. Efforts to revive her at hospital failed and she was pronounced dead moments later, according to London police headquarters Scotland Yard. Damilola, 10, bled to death after being attacked on his way home from Oliver Goldsmith Primary School in November 2000. He staggered 100 yards with blood pouring from a sliced artery in his leg after being stabbed. Nigerian-born Damilola had been in Britain for only a few months when he was attacked while walking home from an after school computer club. Damilola's killing was front-page news in Britain, and prompted soul-searching on topics ranging from the deprivation of inner cities to school bullying. A year after their son's death, the Taylors established the Damilola Taylor Trust, aimed at improving the lives of underprivileged young people. The trust offers scholarships for medical students from poor backgrounds, and also set up the Damilola Taylor Center, in Peckham, south-east London, which provides sports and community activities. At the time, Gloria said the trust aimed to provide hope and opportunities for Britain's \"downtrodden and underprivileged youth\". \"Damilola lost his life because of enormous problems in this society.

A KC-135 tanker lands at Incirlik Air Base in southern Turkey in 2003. Turkey, a longtime U.S. ally and NATO partner, was incensed by the resolution calling the killing of Armenians by Ottoman Turks genocide and threatened to block access to Incirlik Air Base after the resolution passed a House committee vote. The base, in southern Turkey near Syria, is a major resupply center for U.S. operations in Iraq and elsewhere in the Mideast and Asia. The Pentagon is preparing to set up new supply routes for troops in Iraq if Turkey cuts off U.S. access to the strategically important Incirlik, military officials said Tuesday. Ankara acknowledges the killings of Armenians during World War I but vehemently objects to the \"genocide\" label. The House Foreign Affairs Committee last week adopted the nonbinding resolution. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would bring the measure to a vote of the full House sometime next month. But the Bush administration urged Congress to drop the issue, and some leading Democrats urged Pelosi not to bring it to the floor. Majority Leader Steny Hoyer signaled Tuesday that the vote might be put off. \"I said I thought we would bring this up prior to us leaving here,\" said Hoyer of Maryland. \"I have not changed on that, although I would be less than candid to say that there are a number of people who.", "Summarize the following article: SANTIAGO, Chile (CNN) -- Nearly 100 former Chilean soldiers and secret police will be prosecuted on charges they tried to cover up the disappearance and deaths of 119 people during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, a judge ordered Monday. Former Chilean President Augusto Pinochet, pictured in 2000. The disappearances occurred between 1974 and 1975, during what was known as \"Operation Colombo,\" which targeted Pinochet's opponents. Chile's military government published information outside the country to make it seem that the victims had died fighting guerrillas. Chilean magistrate Victor Montiglio based his order on an investigation that says 60 victims were illegally arrested by the Office of National Intelligence (DINA) and kept in detention centers before they disappeared. DINA's former director, retired Gen. Manuel Contreras, has already been sentenced to 250 years in prison in other cases involving human rights violations. He found out about Montiglio's ruling in his prison cell. Minister of Justice Carlos Maldonado said the former soldiers will be taken to military compounds after they appear before Montiglio on Tuesday. The civilian suspects will be jailed in the Santiago Uno and Punta Peuco penal facilities, which are outside Santiago, he said. A U.S. backed-coup toppled democratically elected President Salvador Allende in 1973, after which Pinochet took power. In March 2008, a court in Chile sentenced 24 former police officers for their roles in kidnappings, torture and murders that happened just after the coup, Chile's Judicial Authority said. Thousands of Chileans were victims of the national crime wave.

Juan Roman Riquelme celebrates after scoring his first goal in Argentina's win against Bolivia. The midfielder followed up his brace of spectacular free-kicks in the opening 2-0 victory against Chile to help put his country five points clear of second-placed Brazil, who play Peru in Lima on Sunday. Riquelme again shrugged off his lack of club action with Villarreal, where he has fallen out with the Spanish side's management, to net twice in the second spell after Sergio Aguero gave the home side a first-half lead. The 19-year-old scored his first goal at international level five minutes before the interval after starting in a three-man attack with Carlos Tevez and Lionel Messi. He headed home after Martin Demichelis nodded a cross from Manchester United striker Tevez back across goal. Riquelme added the second 11 minutes after the break with a dipping free-kick which beat Carlos Arias from 25 yards, having been superbly denied by the keeper's one-handed effort shortly beforehand. And he finished off the scoring in the 73rd minute with a cool sidefoot finish after being set up by Messi to cap off a match in which captain Javier Zanetti made a record-breaking 116th appearance for Argentina.

Half of his left arm was amputated and some of the fingers were blown off his right hand. Ziegel, a 25-year-old Marine sergeant, knew the dangers of war when he was deployed for his second tour in Iraq. But he didn't expect a new battle when he returned home as a wounded warrior: a fight with the Department of Veterans Affairs. \"Sometimes, you get lost in the system,\" he told CNN. \"I feel like a Social Security number.

Fayetteville police found her body late Saturday morning when they responded to a call about a strong odor coming from one of the rooms.
